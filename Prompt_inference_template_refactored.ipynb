95 ci 0.3897 - 0.7491 ; p0.0002 ) . in summary , this study demonstrated that br significantly improved pfs and cr rates , compared with r - chop , in patients with fl , mcl , and wm . the stil study is now underway to investigate the effect of duration of maintenance therapy with rituximab in fl , and the effect of ritux - imab maintenance therapy in other low - grade lymphoma entities . in the nhl 7 - 2008 ( maintain ) study ( nct00877214 ) , patients with fl will be randomized to either 2 or 4 years of rit - uximab maintenance therapy , every 2 months , following br induction therapy in addition , infectious complications can be studied prospectively in this patient population , which is important because it has been reported that rituximab treatment is associated with neutropenia and increases infectious complications.8 another part of the maintain study is designed to investigate the efficacy of maintenance therapy in other forms of low - grade lymphoma . patients with wm , mzl , or mcl will be randomized to either 2 years of maintenance therapy with rit - uximab every 2 months , or 2 years of watch and wait , both following br induction . studies with other agents are also ongoing . as discussed above , combination therapy with bortezomib , npld , fludarabine , and rituximab was shown in a small study to be effective in relapsed mcl.6 the stil nhl 8 - 2010 study plans to further investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with bortezomib in patients with relapsed low - grade lymphomas . lenalido - mide is another promising therapy in low - grade lymphomas , which has demonstrated good results in patients with several lymphoma types , in hard - to - treat relapsed or refractory disease . low - grade lymphomas will become chronic diseases , and many patients will require treatment over long periods of time , with many treatment cycles . r - chop is commonly used to treat low - grade lymphoma , though chlorambucil- and fludarabine - based regimens are also used . the efficacy and toxicity of r - chop may be improved by substitution of npld into this combination , although data on the use of liposomal doxorubicin are currently more focused on aggressive lymphomas . br therapy has produced promising results in several types of low - grade lymphoma , both in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes , and is recommended in the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) clinical practice guidelines in oncology ( v 1.2011 ) as first - line therapy for indolent lymphoma.11 the use of rituximab maintenance treatment after br induction is currently under investigation in different lymphoma types . in addition , the efficacy of a combination treatment of bortezomib and br will be studied .

invasive blood pressure ( nibp ) , and a pulse oximetry , and before anesthesia , her blood pressure was 8561 mmhg ; her heart rate was 160 beats min with 100 oxygen saturation . 10 mg of ketamine was iv injected and after loss of consciousness , 5 mg of rocunium was iv injected . when the muscles were sufficiently relaxed , an uncuffed endotracheal tube with a 4 mm inside diameter was intubated . after intubation , both lungs were checked through a stethoscope and found to be normal , and the endotracheal tube was set to 11 cm in accordance with the top front teeth . anesthesia was maintained by 2 l min of air , 2 l min of o2 , and 2.0 - 3.5 vol of sevoflurane . the tidal volume was 90 ml ; respiratory rate was 18min through volume - controlled mechanical ventilation to maintain an end - tidal co2 ( etco2 ) pressure of 35 - 40 mmhg and the peak inspiratory pressure ( pip ) at this point was 19 cmh2o . an adult endoscope with a 9 mm outer diameter was used for the removal procedure because the hospital did not have a pediatric endoscope with forceps . 2 minutes after inserting the endoscope , severe abdominal inflation was observed , and pip increased up to 28 - 30 cmh2o with the tidal volume decreasing to less than 50 ml . the battery had caused an inflammatory change and conglutinated onto surrounding tissue in the esophagus , and 3 minutes after inserting the endoscope , oxygen saturation decreased to 80 , and etco2 pressure rose to 70 mmhg therefore the surgery was stopped and the endoscope was removed . by manual ventilation using 100 oxygen , oxygen saturation was recovered to 100 and etco2 pressure to 40 mmhg , and thereafter , the endoscope was reinserted . in the second attempt of the procedure , manual ventilation was done instead of mechanical ventilation . however , 1 minute after the insertion of the endoscope , a sudden strong resistance was felt in the reservoir bag , and the tidal volume was less than 20 ml despite applying more than 35 cmh2o for the pip . oxygen saturation dropped below 60 so the procedure could not be continued ; therefore , the endoscope was removed again . here , a pip of 25 - 30 cmh2o and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained . the endoscope was reinserted after recovering oxygen saturation to 100 , but due to the increased airway pressure , ventilation was not possible , and oxygen saturation dropped back down to less than 40 . the authors suspected the possibility of tef considering the period of intake and the excessive air volume seen in the stomach in the chest radiograph taken before the surgery . hence , the endotracheal tube was inserted until one lung ventilation was possible and then retreated while auscultating to secure onto the location where the pulmonary sound from both lungs became equal . the adjusted position of the endotracheal tube was 15 cm based on the top front teeth . a pip of 25 - 30 cmh2o and a tidal volume of 80 - 100 ml were maintained . in the next insertion of the endoscope , a pip of 30 cmh2o and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained but abdominal inflation was excessive so air in the stomach was partially removed with the endoscope , and the operating doctor was required to use the minimal amount of air for the surgery to proceed . a pip of 25 - 30 cmh2o , a tidal volume of 50 - 80 ml , and oxygen saturation of 100 were maintained during the procedure , and the battery was removed . after the removal of the battery , the vital signs were blood pressure 9669 mmhg , heart rate 152 beats min , and 100 oxygen saturation . the patient was not extubated but moved to postoperative intensive care , and after pediatrics observed vital signs for about 3 hours to verify that there were no abnormalities , extubation was done . subsequent vital sign checks and physical exam were normal , and there were no abnormalities found in the blood test . moreover , the right main bronchus appeared on the screen in the postoperative esophagography ( fig . 3 ) , and the chest ct scan found tef at 1.4 cm in the upper carina ( fig . 4 ) . the guardian wanted to have surgery for tef at another hospital ; therefore , 3 days after the surgery , she was transferred . ingested batteries usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract and are defecated in a few days , but when it is caught in the esophagus , the moist environment of the esophagus allows for the discharge of substances inside the battery together with electrical discharges , which can cause tissue damage of the esophagus . in addition , necrosis can develop in the mucus membrane of the esophagus due to the pressure from the battery , and these can trigger complications such as esophageal burns , perforation , and tef . more severe complications arose in cases where the diameter of the battery was larger than 20 mm and the infant was younger than 4 years old . the main factors that cause severe complications in battery ingestion were the size ( larger than 20 - 30 mm ) and components of the battery . especially if the negative terminal of the battery is attached to the tissue , it can lead to more severe results . in addition , lithium batteries cause the most severe damages , and it was reported that in a dog  is esophagus , necrosis developed in the trachea within an hour . in this case study , the corroded battery and inflamed mucous membrane of the esophagus were confirmed in endoscopy before the surgery , but tef could not be tested and confirmed due to the urgency of the surgery . it is reported that esophageal burns start 4 hours after battery ingestion and perforations that form fistulas start in 6 hours . since the estimated ingestion period for this case was 3 days , it is enough time for tef to develop . the infant in this case study did not have respiratory difficulties before of the surgery , but ventilation failure during the surgery was because the endotracheal tube was fixed at 11 cm at first . the tef located approximately 2.6 cm under the end of the endotracheal tube allowed the inhalation gas for the anesthesia to flow into the stomach leading to abdominal inflation , and consecutively , the air injected for the endoscopic surgery flowed over to the respiratory tract to greatly increase the airway pressure . afterwards , when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply into the carina , the tube was located past the tef so the influence of tef was eliminated for the decrease in airway pressure . when there is tef , it is important to position the endotracheal tube above the carina and below the tef to maintain anesthesia . this is because effective ventilation would not happen due to a loss of the tidal volume through the fistulous openings in the tef , the contents of the stomach being aspirated into the lungs , and excessive positive pressure ventilation when inducing anesthesia can cause abdominal inflation and cardiovascular suppression . however , in our case , ventilation was not completely recovered even when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply to eliminate the influence of tef , and this is thought to be from accompanying ventilation failure from the endoscope . this ventilation failure can be caused by pressure on the pharynx and the trachea from the weight of the endoscope , or motor abnormality of the diaphragm due to abdominal inflation from the injected air . wengrower et al . reported that approximately 7 of infants who had endoscopic procedures under sedation or anesthesia exhibited temporary desaturation . there are reports that an infant with a similar height and weight developed ventilation failure from a tee probe with outer diameter of 10 8 mm . in our case , the fact that direct pressure on the respiratory tract was applied by using an adult endoscope with a 9 mm diameter and that air had to be injected continually since the battery had attached itself to the esophagus and was hard to remove could have been some other causes for the excessive airway pressure , ventilation failure , and hypoxemia . when upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures were done on 99 infants of 0.9 - 10.1 kg using an endoscope with a 5.2 mm outer diameter , only 1 infant with global developmental delay exhibited hypoxemia , and gryboski recommended using endoscopes with a 5 mm outer diameter on infants with esophageal diseases . it is important to use pediatric endoscopes with the smallest possible outer diameters to prevent hypoxemia during endoscopic procedures on infants . since the removal of foreign objects in the esophagus of infants are usually done under general anesthesia , anesthesiologists need to anticipate ventilation failure and hypoxemia from the physical pressure from the procedural equipment and the excessive injection of air and proceed with anesthesia under close cooperation with the operating surgeon . especially when a battery has been ingested , it is necessary to be aware that there could be complications such as tef in the location where the battery is depending on the battery  is components , size , and ingestion period . in addition , to more effectively block the mutual flow of air and anesthetic gas towards either the esophagus or the trachea in the case of a potential tef , a cuffed endotracheal tube should be chosen preferentially and special caution should be taken to fix the position of the tube and in selecting a suitable size for the endoscope used in the procedure .

30 mm ) and components of the battery . especially if the negative terminal of the battery is attached to the tissue , it can lead to more severe results . in addition , lithium batteries cause the most severe damages , and it was reported that in a dog  is esophagus , necrosis developed in the trachea within an hour . in this case study , the corroded battery and inflamed mucous membrane of the esophagus were confirmed in endoscopy before the surgery , but tef could not be tested and confirmed due to the urgency of the surgery . it is reported that esophageal burns start 4 hours after battery ingestion and perforations that form fistulas start in 6 hours . since the estimated ingestion period for this case was 3 days , it is enough time for tef to develop . the infant in this case study did not have respiratory difficulties before of the surgery , but ventilation failure during the surgery was because the endotracheal tube was fixed at 11 cm at first . the tef located approximately 2.6 cm under the end of the endotracheal tube allowed the inhalation gas for the anesthesia to flow into the stomach leading to abdominal inflation , and consecutively , the air injected for the endoscopic surgery flowed over to the respiratory tract to greatly increase the airway pressure . afterwards , when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply into the carina , the tube was located past the tef so the influence of tef was eliminated for the decrease in airway pressure . when there is tef , it is important to position the endotracheal tube above the carina and below the tef to maintain anesthesia . this is because effective ventilation would not happen due to a loss of the tidal volume through the fistulous openings in the tef , the contents of the stomach being aspirated into the lungs , and excessive positive pressure ventilation when inducing anesthesia can cause abdominal inflation and cardiovascular suppression . however , in our case , ventilation was not completely recovered even when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply to eliminate the influence of tef , and this is thought to be from accompanying ventilation failure from the endoscope . this ventilation failure can be caused by pressure on the pharynx and the trachea from the weight of the endoscope , or motor abnormality of the diaphragm due to abdominal inflation from the injected air . wengrower et al . reported that approximately 7 of infants who had endoscopic procedures under sedation or anesthesia exhibited temporary desaturation . there are reports that an infant with a similar height and weight developed ventilation failure from a tee probe with outer diameter of 10 8 mm . in our case , the fact that direct pressure on the respiratory tract was applied by using an adult endoscope with a 9 mm diameter and that air had to be injected continually since the battery had attached itself to the esophagus and was hard to remove could have been some other causes for the excessive airway pressure , ventilation failure , and hypoxemia . when upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures were done on 99 infants of 0.9 - 10.1 kg using an endoscope with a 5.2 mm outer diameter , only 1 infant with global developmental delay exhibited hypoxemia , and gryboski recommended using endoscopes with a 5 mm outer diameter on infants with esophageal diseases . it is important to use pediatric endoscopes with the smallest possible outer diameters to prevent hypoxemia during endoscopic procedures on infants . since the removal of foreign objects in the esophagus of infants are usually done under general anesthesia , anesthesiologists need to anticipate ventilation failure and hypoxemia from the physical pressure from the procedural equipment and the excessive injection of air and proceed with anesthesia under close cooperation with the operating surgeon . especially when a battery has been ingested , it is necessary to be aware that there could be complications such as tef in the location where the battery is depending on the battery  is components , size , and ingestion period . in addition , to more effectively block the mutual flow of air and anesthetic gas towards either the esophagus or the trachea in the case of a potential tef , a cuffed endotracheal tube should be chosen preferentially and special caution should be taken to fix the position of the tube and in selecting a suitable size for the endoscope used in the procedure .', 0], ['Generate a summary 20 times shorter for the following text: alzheimer s disease ( ad ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia ( bpsd ) . these neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly include delusions , hallucinations , agitation , disinhibition , apathy , irritability , anxiety , depression , sleep disturbances , and elation . bpsd are highly common in severe dementia , with 90 of individuals exhibiting at least one behaviour . up to 50 of patients exhibit it has previously been shown that even modest improvements in these behaviours can result in significant improvement in the quality of life ( qol ) for the patient . although there is still a lack of agreement about how qol should be defined and measured , it is generally considered to be a multidimensional construct that includes the individual s subjective experience of life , as well as objective criteria related to activities valued by society . engagement in positive activities , presence of positive affect , absence of negative affect , participation in meaningful activity , and a sense of community are assumed to be correlated with qol in late - stage dementia . there is a growing consensus about the need to measure qol in dementia trials , as such assessments allow researchers to evaluate the benefits and harms of a treatment and elements of health not detected by standard clinical outcomes . however , it is very difficult to determine qol in persons with late - stage dementia as they can not communicate reliably and are not involved in activities widely accepted by others as rewarding . due the severity of cognitive impairment of patients with moderate to severe ad , assessment must rely on proxy reports or direct observation . unfortunately , both of these approaches tend to exclude consideration of the patient s subjective experiences , which many believe to be an inherent feature of qol . the quality of life in late - stage dementia ( qualid ) scale was originally developed by weiner and co - workers in 2000 . the qualid is a late - stage , dementia - specific questionnaire with a one - week window of observation . it provides information about the patient s quality of life through assessments made by proxy informants . the scale consists of 11 items , comprising both positive and negative dimensions of concrete and observable mood and performance , thought to be indicative of qol in late - stage dementia . the items are rated by frequency of occurrence on a five - step scale , and scores are summed to range from 11 ( best qol ) to 55 ( worst qol ) . while the qualid scale has been shown to obtain reliable estimates of qol and validated in patients with severe dementia residing in long - term care facilities , little is known about the scale s responsiveness to change due to therapeutic intervention . the objective of this study was to assess the responsiveness of the qualid scale to changes in bpsd due to a therapeutic intervention in a population of long -

four patients ( 77.4 ) completed the study ; two died of causes unrelated to the memantine treatment , three discontinued due to increasing agitation , one for significant physical deterioration , and one for significantly increased somnolence . at baseline , patients had a mean qualid score of 21.36.2 , with a range from 13 to 40 . table 1 provides the results of changes in outcome measurements over the course of the trial . there were statistically significant differences in scores for npi total ( f3,90 4.035 , p .010 ) and its subscale items : agitation aggression ( f3,90 3.721 , p .014 ) , and irritability ( f3,90 3.899 , p .011 ) ; and cmai total ( f3,90 6.301 , p .001 ) and its subscale items : physical aggression ( f3,90 5.928 , p .001 ) and verbal aggression ( f3,90 3.961 , p .011 ) . no significant improvements were found for qualid ( t 0.278 , p .783 ) , mmse ( t 0.819 , p .419 ) , or cgi ( f3,84 0.760 , p .520 ) . outcome measures at baseline and endpoint qualid scores were compared with scores on the npi , cmai , and cgi at baseline and endpoint ( table 2 ) . at both baseline and endpoint , the qualid scale was correlated with npi total score ( baseline : 0.270 , p .037 ; endpoint : 0.404 , p .002 ) , npi depression ( baseline : 0.332 , p .022 ; endpoint : 0.381 , p .008 ) , npi irritability ( baseline : 0.288 , p .034 ; endpoint : 0.346 , p .011 ) , and cmai verbal aggression ( baseline : 0.349 , p .009 ; endpoint : 0.294 , p .028 ) . the qualid was correlated with npi agitation aggression only at endpoint ( 0.414 , p .002 ) , as was npi anxiety ( 0.290 , p .049 ) , npi hallucinations ( 0.456 , p .002 ) , npi disinhibition ( 0.322 , p .026 ) and cmai total ( 0.277 , p .032 ) . kendall correlations between qualid and other measures correlations between change scores of qualid and other measures between baseline and endpoint correlations were calculated between change scores for the qualid and npi total , npi subscales , cmai and cgi ( table 3 ) . qualid change scores were correlated with change scores in npi apathy ( 0.345 , p .012 ) . however , there were no significant correlations between qualid and cmai , cgi , npi total or any subscales that were correlated with qualid scores at either baseline or endpoint . concurrent validity was tested by comparing changes scores in patients who improved ( n 19 ) based on the npi and patients who did not . a decrease in 4 points in baseline score mean change in qualid was similar between groups ( t 0.873 , p .390 ) . it has been suggested that treatments designed to alleviate bpsd may have beneficial effects for patients qol , as a strong relationship between bpsd and qol has been previously observed . the significant relationship between the npi and cmai with the qualid scores at baseline and final assessment suggest that qol is associated with behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad . this result supports conclusions drawn by previous studies examining the relationship between the qualid scale and bpsd at a single point in time ; however , changes in the qualid score from baseline to endpoint did not correlate with change scores on the npi , cmai or cgi . this lack of relationship suggests that the qualid scale may not be responsive to changes in bpsd . concurrent validity was also tested , by comparing qualid change scores in patients who improved based on the npi and patients who did not . as the mean change in qualid scores was similar between both groups , this once again suggests that the qualid may not be responsive to changes in bpsd . a previous study looking at the responsiveness of the qualid scale to drug treatment found that the qualid was responsive to the changes in bpsd . the discrepancy in this finding may be due to the difference in study length ( i. e. 14 days in the previous study compared to three months in the current ) . it is possible that any short - term benefits from decreased behavioural problems are washed out by deterioration in overall health status over the long term . the population in the previous study included 31 late - stage dementia patients residing in long - term care facilities who were given either olanzapine or risperidone . the patients had a mean baseline qualid of 30.94 and mean npi of 53.48 , both of which are higher than those of the current study and other papers that have studied the qualid scale . this study design reflects a more realistic timeframe for a therapeutic intervention , and is comparable to many other studies using antipsychotics , with a drug that has been shown to improve behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad . the population is similar to most other studies in terms of mean qualid and mmse scores , even though the npi scores were slightly higher than those previously shown . therefore , this analysis presents an appropriate design for a study involving patients with moderate to severe alzheimer s disease residing in long - term care facilities and , as a result , should provide more applicable conclusions regarding the responsiveness of the qualid scale to change when a therapeutic intervention is implemented . it is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments . it is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary . another possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long - term , despite significant improvements in behaviour rating scales . another limitation is the fact that the majority of the patients in this study were male , and therefore the results may not necessarily be applicable to the general population of institutionalized patients with dementia . however , gender does not appear to have a significant effect on quality of life in those with dementia . while one study did find that being female was a significant predictor of lower quality of life as measured by the qualid , there was no difference between males and females in actual qualid scores , and the authors did not consider the results robust . it is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments . it is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary . another possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long -

of them , 5 ( 7.9 ) participants were excluded because of poor respiratory cooperation ( n3 , 4.8 ) , rib shadow ( n1 , 1.6 ) , and a severely atrophic liver ( n1 , 1.6 ) . finally , 58 patients were included in the data analysis and their characteristics are shown in table 1 . of the 58 patients , 18 patients ( 31.0 ) had no ev , and 12 ( 20.7 ) , 11 ( 19.0 ) , and 17 ( 29.3 ) patients had grade 1 , 2 , and 3 ev , respectively . compared with the non - ev group , the hvat , hv ha , and psi were significantly decreased in the ev groups ( p0.001 , p0.001 , p0.010 , respectively ) , and pv ha increased significantly ( p0.024 ) . similar results were observed in the high - risk group compared with the low - risk group ( p0.001 for hvat , p0.001 for hv ha , p0.013 for psi , respectively ) . furthermore , pvat increased significantly in the high - risk group compared with the low - risk group ( p0.019 ) . ha , and psi were negatively correlated with the grade of ev . on the contrary , roc curves were computed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of features with significant correlation with the grade of ev ( table 4 , figure 3 ) . for the assessment of the presence of ev and high - risk ev , for the diagnosis of the presence of ev , the auroc was 0.883 , and the optimal cut - off value of hv ha was 8.2 seconds with a sensitivity of 85 and a specificity of 78 . for the diagnosis of high - risk ev , the auroc was 0.915 , and the optimal cut - off value of hv ha was 7.0 s with a sensitivity of 82 and a specificity of 90 . in this case , the false - positive and false - negative rates of hv ha were relatively low ( table 5 ) . in pairwise comparison of the aurocs , for evaluating the presence of ev , the differences between features were not significant ; for the evaluation of high - risk ev , hv ha allowed better assessment of high - risk ev compared with hvat , pv ha , and psi ( p0.006 , p0.009 , p0.006 , respectively ) . ceus is widely used in cld patients , such as in assessing the severity of liver fibrosis and ph , and theoretically , ceus features may correlate with ev . under this assumption , we conducted a pilot study utilizing ceus to predict the presence of ev and high - risk ev to relieve the burden on patients and medical service providers by reducing unnecessary endoscopy . this study focused on cirrhotic patients with hbv and showed that several ceus features were closely correlated with the grade of ev ; moreover , the hv hvat has been reported in previous studies to be useful for evaluating portal pressure and staging liver fibrosis , because the structure of intrahepatic vasculature is changed by fibrous tissue , leading to arteriovenous shunting , and to some extent , arteriovenous shunting and arterialization of the sinusoidal bed , which may elevate the portal pressure . ev as a result of ph was developed to relieve the high portal pressure and help the obstructed portal venous system to bypass the liver and flow into the systemic circulation . this study showed that the hvat was closely negatively correlated with the grade of ev ( r0.589 , p0.001 ) ; therefore , hvat can be a good indicator for predicting the presence of ev and assessing high - risk ev ( auroc : 0.838 and 0.840 ) , with the cut - off values of 22 s and 20.8 s , respectively . however , hvat is vulnerable to patient individual circulation time , how the contrast agent is injected , and when the timer is started . in clinical practice , hvat is easy to perform but is less reliable than hv ha . ha index had been used in many studies to correct the differences of participants blood circulation time . as expected , the aurocs of hv ha was larger than that of hvat ( 0.883 vs. 0.838 for assessing presence of ev and 0.915 vs. 0.840 for assessing high - risk ev ) . in addition , this index seems to be more reliable than hvat and is also feasible as a clinical tool . ha was significantly correlated with ev grade ( r0.296 , p0.024 ) , its performance was insufficient for assessing the presence of ev and high - risk ev ( auroc , 0.726 and 0.714 , respectively ) . we hypothesized that this ceus feature would tend to reflect the blood content of the liver in the different stages of cld . the liver is rich in blood , like a blood - pool ; however , fibrosis and regenerative nodules increase with the progression of cld ; therefore , the blood - pool space is reduced . in the ceus images , reduced content of microbubble - filled blood - pool produces a reduction in signal intensity . on the other hand , although not conclusive , hepatic arterial buffer response may decrease when the compensation of collateral circulation reaches a peak . the aurocs of psi were 0.710 for assessing the presence of ev and 0.672 for evaluating the high - risk ev . compared with hv ha , the diagnostic accuracy of pis was significantly lower ( p0.006 ) . ttp has been used to evaluate the severity of ph in cirrhosis , but its performance was unsatisfactory . in addition , another study reported a disappointing result of rise time for assessing ph in patients with cirrhosis . although spleen length and portal vein diameter are easy to measure , a systematic review showed that they are not accurate enough to predict ev . serum tests are popular to use in diagnosing ev of liver cirrhosis , but the indexes , including apri , aar , fib-4 , lok , and forns scores , had low - to - moderate diagnostic accuracy in predicting ev in liver cirrhosis . on the other hand , ct was reported to diagnose ev in liver cirrhosis with high accuracy , but ct can not be used for patients with renal failure due to the adverse effect of radiocontrast agent . in addition , ct has high cost , static imaging ( non - dynamitic ) , and radioactive by - effects . in addition , mri is not a dynamic imaging system , which was reported as the robustness of pv flow measurement on only 1 slice at a specific time point . doppler indexes have been used to diagnose ev for many years , but the results are unsatisfactory even today . liver stiffness measured by transient elastography showed a good correlation with the severity of ev , and this approach is simple and reproducible . however , the cut - off values vary between studies ( range , 13.9 kpa to 21.5 kpa for predicting the presence of ev ) ; thus , it has not been used in clinical practice . examined the lower esophagus by ceus directly and found the thickness of mucosa and submucosa was strongly correlated with the grade of ev , with an auroc of 0.987 for detecting large ev ( the criteria for ev grade were not provided ) . this approach is direct and interesting , but has a few disadvantages : it can not detect the middle and upper esophagus , and it is vulnerable to overlying gastrointestinal gas ; in addition , the contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter in the resting state may squash the varicose esophageal veins . included 25 control participants , and 9 , 13 , and 34 patients with small , medium , and large ev , respectively , but did not include cirrhotic patients without ev . to some extent , this proportion of patients may increase the diagnostic performance . in addition , the number of participants was small and further studies are needed to confirm this approach . compared with the above - mentioned techniques , intrahepatic transit time ( i. e. hv ha ) was accurate , easy to detect , widely studied , and directly and closely correlated with the distortion of hepatic vascular architecture that may lead to ph and ev . in this study , the interval between endoscopy and ceus imaging was limited to within 60 days . according to previous studies on noninvasive assessment of ev , a 180-day interval is considered acceptable . good respiratory cooperation was needed in this ceus imaging process in order to avoid losing the target vessel , especially near the arrival time . although participants had been briefly trained before the measurement , a 4.8 failure rate was still obtained . to the best to our knowledge , manual injection of the contrast agent was the common method in ceus imaging ;

therefore , the previous results are unreliable and further validation is necessary . recently , contrast - enhanced ultrasonography ( ceus ) has been widely used in liver imaging , such as characterizing focal lesions . compared with contrast - enhanced ct and contrast - enhanced mri , ceus is low cost , repeatable , safer , and can be controlled by operators in real - time during the measurements . moreover , previous studies have demonstrated that hepatic dynamic ceus features are correlated with severity of chronic liver diseases ( cld ) , degree of liver fibrosis , and portal pressure . in patients with cirrhosis , however , the usefulness of liver dynamic ceus features for assessing the ev has not been evaluated . the present study aimed to investigate the usefulness of ceus in predicting esophageal varices ( ev ) and assessing high - risk ev in patients with hbv - related cirrhosis . between oct 2014 and dec 2016 , consecutive patients with hbv - related cirrhosis who had undergone endoscopy and agreed to participate in this study were recruited . the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on liver biopsy according to the metavir scoring system . patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) more than 18 years old ;

moreover , ttp was defined as the time interval between injection and liver parenchyma peak time . to lessen the impact of variations in the blood circulation time , hv ha ( hvat minus haat ) and pv ha ( pvat minus haat ) were calculated . the time from 10 to 90 of liver parenchyma peak signal intensity was expressed as the rise time . ev was diagnosed according to the published criteria : grade 0 , no varices ;

moreover , ttp was defined as the time interval between injection and liver parenchyma peak time . to lessen the impact of variations in the blood circulation time , hv ha ( hvat minus haat ) and pv ha ( pvat minus haat ) were calculated . the time from 10 to 90 of liver parenchyma peak signal intensity was expressed as the rise time . ev was diagnosed according to the published criteria : grade 0 , no varices ; 1 , straight small varices ; 2 , beaded medium - sized varices ; and 3 , nodular , tortuous , and tumor - like large varices . the grades 0 and 1 ev patients were defined as a low - bleeding - risk group and grades 2 and 3 patients were considered at a high - risk of ev bleeding . data were presented as mean standard deviation if they were normally distributed , or expressed as median ( interquartile range ) . data were compared between groups using student t - test or test , as appropriate . the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( auroc ) was computed to explore the diagnostic performance of ceus features . spss 17.0 software ( chicago , il ) and medcalc 12.7.0.0 software ( mariakerke , belgium ) were used in this study . in this prospective study , ceus was performed on 63 eligible patients ; of them , 5 ( 7.9 ) participants were excluded because of poor respiratory cooperation ( n3 , 4.8 ) , rib shadow ( n1 , 1.6 ) , and a severely atrophic liver ( n1 , 1.6 ) . finally , 58 patients were included in the data analysis and their characteristics are shown in table 1 . of the 58 patients , 18 patients ( 31.0 ) had no ev , and 12 ( 20.7 ) , 11 ( 19.0 ) , and 17 ( 29.3 ) patients had grade 1 , 2 , and 3 ev , respectively . compared with the non - ev group , the hvat , hv ha , and psi were significantly decreased in the ev groups ( p0.001 , p0.001 , p0.010 , respectively ) , and pv ha increased significantly ( p0.024 ) . similar results were observed in the high - risk group compared with the low - risk group ( p0.001 for hvat , p0.001 for hv ha , p0.013 for psi , respectively ) . furthermore , pvat increased significantly in the high - risk group compared with the low - risk group ( p0.019 ) . ha , and psi were negatively correlated with the grade of ev . on the contrary , roc curves were computed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of features with significant correlation with the grade of ev ( table 4 , figure 3 ) . for the assessment of the presence of ev and high - risk ev , for the diagnosis of the presence of ev , the auroc was 0.883 , and the optimal cut - off value of hv ha was 8.2 seconds with a sensitivity of 85 and a specificity of 78 . for the diagnosis of high - risk ev , the auroc was 0.915 , and the optimal cut - off value of hv ha was 7.0 s with a sensitivity of 82 and a specificity of 90 . in this case , the false - positive and false - negative rates of hv ha were relatively low ( table 5 ) . in pairwise comparison of the aurocs , for evaluating the presence of ev , the differences between features were not significant ; for the evaluation of high - risk ev , hv ha allowed better assessment of high - risk ev compared with hvat , pv ha , and psi ( p0.006 , p0.009 , p0.006 , respectively ) . ceus is widely used in cld patients , such as in assessing the severity of liver fibrosis and ph , and theoretically , ceus features may correlate with ev . under this assumption , we conducted a pilot study utilizing ceus to predict the presence of ev and high - risk ev to relieve the burden on patients and medical service providers by reducing unnecessary endoscopy . this study focused on cirrhotic patients with hbv and showed that several ceus features were closely correlated with the grade of ev ; moreover , the hv hvat has been reported in previous studies to be useful for evaluating portal pressure and staging liver fibrosis , because the structure of intrahepatic vasculature is changed by fibrous tissue , leading to arteriovenous shunting , and to some extent , arteriovenous shunting and arterialization of the sinusoidal bed , which may elevate the portal pressure . ev as a result of ph was developed to relieve the high portal pressure and help the obstructed portal venous system to bypass the liver and flow into the systemic circulation . this study showed that the hvat was closely negatively correlated with the grade of ev ( r0.589 , p0.001 ) ; therefore , hvat can be a good indicator for predicting the presence of ev and assessing high - risk ev ( auroc : 0.838 and 0.840 ) , with the cut - off values of 22 s and 20.8 s , respectively . however , hvat is vulnerable to patient individual circulation time , how the contrast agent is injected , and when the timer is started . in clinical practice , hvat is easy to perform but is less reliable than hv ha . ha index had been used in many studies to correct the differences of participants blood circulation time . as expected , the aurocs of hv ha was larger than that of hvat ( 0.883 vs. 0.838 for assessing presence of ev and 0.915 vs. 0.840 for assessing high - risk ev ) . in addition , this index seems to be more reliable than hvat and is also feasible as a clinical tool . ha was significantly correlated with ev grade ( r0.296 , p0.024 ) , its performance was insufficient for assessing the presence of ev and high - risk ev ( auroc , 0.726 and 0.714 , respectively ) . we hypothesized that this ceus feature would tend to reflect the blood content of the liver in the different stages of cld . the liver is rich in blood , like a blood - pool ; however , fibrosis and regenerative nodules increase with the progression of cld ; therefore , the blood - pool space is reduced . in the ceus images , reduced content of microbubble - filled blood - pool produces a reduction in signal intensity . on the other hand , although not conclusive , hepatic arterial buffer response may decrease when the compensation of collateral circulation reaches a peak . the aurocs of psi were 0.710 for assessing the presence of ev and 0.672 for evaluating the high - risk ev . compared with hv ha , the diagnostic accuracy of pis was significantly lower ( p0.006 ) . ttp has been used to evaluate the severity of ph in cirrhosis , but its performance was unsatisfactory . in addition , another study reported a disappointing result of rise time for assessing ph in patients with cirrhosis . although spleen length and portal vein diameter are easy to measure , a systematic review showed that they are not accurate enough to predict ev . serum tests are popular to use in diagnosing ev of liver cirrhosis , but the indexes , including apri , aar , fib-4 , lok , and forns scores , had low - to - moderate diagnostic accuracy in predicting ev in liver cirrhosis . on the other hand , ct was reported to diagnose ev in liver cirrhosis with high accuracy , but ct can not be used for patients with renal failure due to the adverse effect of radiocontrast agent . in addition , ct has high cost , static imaging ( non - dynamitic ) , and radioactive by - effects . in addition , mri is not a dynamic imaging system , which was reported as the robustness of pv flow measurement on only 1 slice at a specific time point . doppler indexes have been used to diagnose ev for many years , but the results are unsatisfactory even today . liver stiffness measured by transient elastography showed a good correlation with the severity of ev , and this approach is simple and reproducible . however , the cut - off values vary between studies ( range , 13.9 kpa to 21.5 kpa for predicting the presence of ev ) ; thus , it has not been used in clinical practice . examined the lower esophagus by ceus directly and found the thickness of mucosa and submucosa was strongly correlated with the grade of ev , with an auroc of 0.987 for detecting large ev ( the criteria for ev grade were not provided ) . this approach is direct and interesting , but has a few disadvantages : it can not detect the middle and upper esophagus , and it is vulnerable to overlying gastrointestinal gas ; in addition , the contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter in the resting state may squash the varicose esophageal veins . included 25 control participants , and 9 , 13 , and 34 patients with small , medium , and large ev , respectively , but did not include cirrhotic patients without ev . to some extent , this proportion of patients may increase the diagnostic performance . in addition , the number of participants was small and further studies are needed to confirm this approach . compared with the above - mentioned techniques , intrahepatic transit time ( i. e. hv ha ) was accurate , easy to detect , widely studied , and directly and closely correlated with the distortion of hepatic vascular architecture that may lead to ph and ev . in this study , the interval between endoscopy and ceus imaging was limited to within 60 days . according to previous studies on noninvasive assessment of ev , a 180-day interval is considered acceptable . good respiratory cooperation was needed in this ceus imaging process in order to avoid losing the target vessel , especially near the arrival time . although participants had been briefly trained before the measurement , a 4.8 failure rate was still obtained . to the best to our knowledge , manual injection of the contrast agent was the common method in ceus imaging ; however , a mechanical device may be more accurate and feasible in clinical work . second , all the ceus imaging data were analyzed by 1 researcher ; thus , reader variability may be a drawback of this study . however , the process for ceus imaging analysis in this study was standardized and the results were computed automatically , thereby minimizing variability between different readers . in conclusion , dynamic ceus may be used for the assessment of ev , and hv ha is the best index in predicting ev . considering the results of previous studies , hv ha may provide a comprehensive assessment for patients with cld in many aspects , such as the degree of fibrosis , the severity of ph , and the grade of ev . although dynamic ceus imaging may not replace endoscopy completely , this technique is helpful in evaluating whether patients with hbv - related cirrhosis , particularly those who present a high risk of ev , should undergo endoscopy .', 3], ['Generate a summary of lenght 75 words: charging of grains of identical insulating materials during collisions has been of considerable interest recently , both for its intrinsic physics and for its applications to situations ranging from volcanic dust plumes and desert sandstorms to industrial powder processing . however , work up to now has not explained why in some instances charging grows , rather than diminishes as one might naively expect , and can run away extremely rapidly , leading to electrical discharges : lightning . outstanding examples of runaway collisional charging involve ice , in thunderstorms both on earth and on other planets , and , it is speculated , in the solar nebula ; these instances concern granular media whose particles also undergo nucleation , growth , and fission , so that they , in effect , reproduce . in this work , we demonstrate with a minimal dynamical model that secondary nucleation , production of a new particle from an existing particle , is a key process in producing runaway electrical charging in self - replicating granular matter . we concomitantly present the results of experiments on growing ice in situ from the vapor phase within an environmental scanning electron microscope . we show that an effect of the electric field is to induce the formation of fast - growing ice palms intermediate in morphology between whiskers and dendrites ;

thus described vonnegut the tremendous metamorphosis a cumulus cloud undergoes to become a cumulonimbus or thundercloud . thundercloud electrification is a consequence of ice particles colliding within a cloud and exchanging electrical charge . charge dipole development in a thunderstorm is due to the physical separation of particles with opposite charges inside the cloud : larger , heavier particles will fall , while smaller , lighter particles will rise in the updraft , owing to their different dynamics , and these particles carry different charges . usually , in thunderstorms , the smaller ice particle is an ice crystal and carries positive charge aloft in the updraft ; the larger graupel ice particle falls with an opposite negative charge , leading to a typical thunderstorm . we may contrast the foregoing with charging in other granular media , where it has been argued that simple geometry , without growth and fission processes , leads to a net transfer of electrons from larger to smaller particles , so that smaller particles tend to charge negatively and larger ones positively . whether this differential charging tendency operates one way or the other depends on the microphysics , which differs for different materials , so this polarity differs . for our present purposes , however , what is relevant is that there should exist such a triboelectric charging tendency in one sense or the other . here we build a minimal model ( figure 1 ) incorporating solely the collisional dynamics of charge transfer plus nucleation , growth , and fission processes , which we aim to have general relevance to self - replicating granular media . anatomy of our minimal model of charging of friable self - replicating granular matter through secondary nucleation , incorporating the processes of particle growth ( ri ri 1 ) , advection ( with speed ui ) , collision , charge transfer , and fission ( with probability s ) . we consider ( figure 1 ) a one - dimensional system of length l , within which we place randomly n neutrally charged particles , qi 0 for i 1 .. , n , of size ri extracted from a gaussian distribution of sizes with mean r 1 and standard deviation . these particles grow at a constant rate , independent of particle size , that sets the time scale of the problem . at the same time , they sediment in an upward flow of constant magnitude at their terminal velocity , ui , determined by the instantaneous balance of fluid drag and gravitational forces . the sedimentation speed is normalized by the updraft speed ( i. e. ui 1 for passive tracers ) and is approximated by a linear function of the particle size ri , ui 1 ( ri rc ) . this function is positive ( negative ) for ri below ( above ) a critical value rc . the sedimentation speed of all particles in the simulation is updated every integration time step ; in this way , small particles that are initially advected upward by the updraft slow their upward motion as they grow and begin moving downward after reaching the threshold rc . when the trajectories of two particles i and j cross , they collide . to overcome the 1d limitation of the model , we allow particles to get past one another after the collision , so that after each time step particles end up in whatever final position their velocities prescribe . both mass and charge are conserved during a collision but , while charge is transferred in every collision ( the smaller particle leaving the collision positively charged : qi qi 1 and qj qj 1 with ri rj ) , we assign a certain probability s for fission to occur for each of the two particles involved in a collision . if fission does occur for particle i , a new , neutrally charged particle with radius 1 splits from it , reducing its size to ri ri 1 . although fracture of particles has been shown to lead to additional charging , we left this effect out of the model for the sake of simplicity as it does not change qualitatively the presented results . boundary conditions are absorbing : particles leaving the system through the upper or lower boundary are absorbed there , and do not participate further in the dynamics , but their charge accumulates to the total charge at the boundaries : qu(l ) qi for i leaving the system through the upper ( lower ) boundary , respectively . the total large - scale charge separation is calculated as q qu ql . for given initial conditions ( set completely by the concentration of particles , n l , and the initial spread of the size distribution , ) , the behavior of our minimal model then depends on just two parameters , the critical radius rc and the secondary nucleation rate s. in what follows , we set rc 8 , 2 and 0.1 and explore the behavior of the model with respect to the secondary nucleation rate s. we note that electric forces are not considered in the model but implicitly ( through the secondary nucleation rate responsible for the process of fission ) . figure 2 displays the typical transient dynamics of the charge distribution in the model . the figure shows an initial stage in the transient dynamics chosen to exemplify how the charge separation process operates in the model . as time passes , as indicated by black arrows , light positively charged particles move toward the upper boundary while heavy negatively charged ones move in the opposite direction , contributing to a non - negligible dipolar large scale charge separation q . regions where localized collisions are produced generate large charges that are then separated by differential advection . even at those early stages in the process , the global dipolar structure of the system , quantified by the large - scale charge difference between the boundaries q , is the dominant field . figure 3 shows particle size and charge distributions for the upper and lower boundaries . as time passes , light positively charged particles move toward the upper boundary while heavy negatively charged ones move in the opposite direction , as indicated by arrows , contributing to a non - negligible large - scale dipolar charge distribution q . particle size ( rj ) and charge ( qj ) distributions for the system upper boundary ( left panels ) and lower boundary ( right panels ) . the total charge separation q at a finite time step ( which is a measure of the speed of the charge - separation process ) displays nonmonotonic discontinuous behavior as a function of the secondary nucleation rate s. below a critical value sc , the long - term dynamics reaches an emptying state with no particles left in the domain and a finite ( and small ) final charge separation ; as there are few secondary nuclei , the initial particles grow and collide very little before leaving the system . occasionally some charge is produced , but not much . above sc , the number of collisions grows , and with it the charge transfer . as the charge acquired by the particles is correlated with their size , charge separation occurs too . the system approaches a steady state with an average nonzero number of particles in the domain and an exponentially divergent charge separation , as shown in the inset of figure 4 . this exponential charge growth is limited in nature by electrical discharges , lightning . the total charge separation q displays nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the secondary nucleation rate s. inset : time evolution of q for s 0.1 shows the exponential growth characteristic of all values of s sc . however , for secondary - nucleation rates much greater than sc , there are more and more collisions . the particles undergo more fission into secondary nuclei , and although much charge is produced , it does not separate as well ; charge separation is still exponentially divergent , but the growth rate decreases beyond sc . there is thus an intermediate optimal value of the secondary nucleation rate to produce the greatest charge separation . this critical value sc 1(rc ) is 0.0625 in the simulations ( dashed line in figure 4 ) . a smaller value of rc ( which means a weaker updraft ) requires secondary nucleation to occur more often ( larger sc ) in order to ensure some particles are advected upward ( leading to charge separation ) , while the initial density of particles . controls the collision probability . it is worth mentioning that even in the limit of very high particle density , in which many collisions occur at early stages , charge separation is minimal in the absence of secondary nucleation . earlier work of ours made us suspect that secondary nucleation ought to be important in runaway collisional charging . previously we have shown that the nonlinear feedback effects of secondary nucleation are responsible for chiral symmetry breaking in experiments involving crystallizing a chiral chemical compound from solution . we showed that secondary nuclei in such stirred crystallization experiments are often easily detached whisker or needle crystallites growing from a mother crystal , and a runaway process involving the formation of secondary nuclei leads to complete chiral symmetry breaking . water molecules possess a high electric polarizability ; they are electrical dipoles and can be highly affected by the presence of an external field . during dendrite growth , an electric field can produce an ordering of the molecular dipoles and increase the molecular flow toward the dendrite tip . this increases the growth velocity , decreases the tip radius and disables the generation of side - branches , producing long whiskers . these effects have long been noted and were studied quantitatively by libbrecht and tanusheva , who measured the tip velocity and found that high voltages could multiply the growth rate more than 10-fold . we hypothesized that this dendrite growth mechanism should be involved in promoting secondary nucleation . thus , we undertook laboratory experiments to see whether similarly easily detached forms as in solution crystallization experiments are produced in ice under the influence of an electric field . we employed a fei quanta 200 environmental scanning electron microscope ( esem ) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cold stage to grow ice in situ at low pressures and at temperatures of 90200 k. the microscope was set up so that the cold finger , together with a thermostat , was directly beneath the substrate ( a silicon wafer attached with silver glue ) . we began by evacuating the chamber in the high - vacuum mode of the microscope ( 6 10 pa ) and lowering the substrate to the working temperature . we first scanned the uncovered sample substrate , on which we grew an ice film by switching to low - vacuum mode and opening the water input microvalve at a pressure of 40 pa for some seconds . we found this was the highest pressure at which we could obtain clear images . we closed the microvalve at or before the point when the substrate temperature increases and can not be maintained at the working temperature , following which we switched back to high - vacuum mode and observed the ice growth in situ . in the electron - microscope chamber , a high - voltage electron beam is used for imaging , and as we display in figure 5 , we find that the electric field produces rapid dendrite growth wherever we charge with electrons by imaging . a typical ice morphology seen under these circumstances is of a form intermediate between whiskers and dendrites , which often takes on the aspect of a palm tree ; see figure 5a . as we zoom out ( figure 5b , c ) , we note that the palm forest is found only where we had been imaging ; outside the area of the electron beam , we find a relatively flat film of ice , while within the imaged zones , three in figure 5c , we find faster ice growth and the ice forest . growth in an esem : ( a , b ) at t 170 k , p 40 pa , v 30 kv , an ice the forest displays the morphology intermediate between whiskers and dendrites typically formed with charged ice . ( c ) in an overview , the three zones where we imaged and charged with electrons stand out , showing the increased growth on the background ice film . we had noted such palmlike forms in previous experiments involving growing ice inside an electron microscope , but had not then realized that the electric field was involved in their production . these experiments are necessarily qualititative , being performed within the chamber of an unmodified esem , but we find the results suggestive : owing to their geometry , the breakage of these structures on collision is likely and will lead to the formation of new nucleation centers . such friable morphologies do not only form in ice under electric fields ; snowflakes too have such delicate structures , but an electric field promotes this form of growth . our minimal physical model of a self - replicating granular material shows how secondary nuclei from such growth can lead to runaway charging . these effects may be present in ice on earth , in terrestrial thunderstorms , and in astrophysical ices , in the solar nebula , and in thunderstorms on other planets , some of which , for example , on venus , may involve self - replicating granular materials other than water ice . it is conceivable that this dynamics is involved in the formation of the martian geological structures called razorbacks . while ice is clearly the most quotidian example of a friable self - replicating granular material , one that breaks easily and continues to grow , other such materials can be both sought in different astrophysical environments , and also produced in technological contexts .

the larger graupel ice particle falls with an opposite negative charge , leading to a typical thunderstorm . we may contrast the foregoing with charging in other granular media , where it has been argued that simple geometry , without growth and fission processes , leads to a net transfer of electrons from larger to smaller particles , so that smaller particles tend to charge negatively and larger ones positively . whether this differential charging tendency operates one way or the other depends on the microphysics , which differs for different materials , so this polarity differs . for our present purposes , however , what is relevant is that there should exist such a triboelectric charging tendency in one sense or the other . here we build a minimal model ( figure 1 ) incorporating solely the collisional dynamics of charge transfer plus nucleation , growth , and fission processes , which we aim to have general relevance to self - replicating granular media . anatomy of our minimal model of charging of friable self - replicating granular matter through secondary nucleation , incorporating the processes of particle growth ( ri ri 1 ) , advection ( with speed ui ) , collision , charge transfer , and fission ( with probability s ) . we consider ( figure 1 ) a one - dimensional system of length l , within which we place randomly n neutrally charged particles , qi 0 for i 1 .. , n , of size ri extracted from a gaussian distribution of sizes with mean r 1 and standard deviation . these particles grow at a constant rate , independent of particle size , that sets the time scale of the problem . at the same time , they sediment in an upward flow of constant magnitude at their terminal velocity , ui , determined by the instantaneous balance of fluid drag and gravitational forces . the sedimentation speed is normalized by the updraft speed ( i. e. ui 1 for passive tracers ) and is approximated by a linear function of the particle size ri , ui 1 ( ri rc ) . this function is positive ( negative ) for ri below ( above ) a critical value rc . the sedimentation speed of all particles in the simulation is updated every integration time step ; in this way , small particles that are initially advected upward by the updraft slow their upward motion as they grow and begin moving downward after reaching the threshold rc . when the trajectories of two particles i and j cross , they collide . to overcome the 1d limitation of the model , we allow particles to get past one another after the collision , so that after each time step particles end up in whatever final position their velocities prescribe . both mass and charge are conserved during a collision but , while charge is transferred in every collision ( the smaller particle leaving the collision positively charged : qi qi 1 and qj qj 1 with ri rj ) , we assign a certain probability s for fission to occur for each of the two particles involved in a collision . if fission does occur for particle i , a new , neutrally charged particle with radius 1 splits from it , reducing its size to ri ri 1 . although fracture of particles has been shown to lead to additional charging , we left this effect out of the model for the sake of simplicity as it does not change qualitatively the presented results . boundary conditions are absorbing : particles leaving the system through the upper or lower boundary are absorbed there , and do not participate further in the dynamics , but their charge accumulates to the total charge at the boundaries : qu(l ) qi for i leaving the system through the upper ( lower ) boundary , respectively . the total large - scale charge separation is calculated as q qu ql . for given initial conditions ( set completely by the concentration of particles , n l , and the initial spread of the size distribution , ) , the behavior of our minimal model then depends on just two parameters , the critical radius rc and the secondary nucleation rate s. in what follows , we set rc 8 , 2 and 0.1 and explore the behavior of the model with respect to the secondary nucleation rate s. we note that electric forces are not considered in the model but implicitly ( through the secondary nucleation rate responsible for the process of fission ) . figure 2 displays the typical transient dynamics of the charge distribution in the model . the figure shows an initial stage in the transient dynamics chosen to exemplify how the charge separation process operates in the model . as time passes , as indicated by black arrows , light positively charged particles move toward the upper boundary while heavy negatively charged ones move in the opposite direction , contributing to a non - negligible dipolar large scale charge separation q . regions where localized collisions are produced generate large charges that are then separated by differential advection . even at those early stages in the process , the global dipolar structure of the system , quantified by the large - scale charge difference between the boundaries q , is the dominant field . figure 3 shows particle size and charge distributions for the upper and lower boundaries . as time passes , light positively charged particles move toward the upper boundary while heavy negatively charged ones move in the opposite direction , as indicated by arrows , contributing to a non - negligible large - scale dipolar charge distribution q . particle size ( rj ) and charge ( qj ) distributions for the system upper boundary ( left panels ) and lower boundary ( right panels ) . the total charge separation q at a finite time step ( which is a measure of the speed of the charge - separation process ) displays nonmonotonic discontinuous behavior as a function of the secondary nucleation rate s. below a critical value sc , the long - term dynamics reaches an emptying state with no particles left in the domain and a finite ( and small ) final charge separation ; as there are few secondary nuclei , the initial particles grow and collide very little before leaving the system . occasionally some charge is produced , but not much . above sc , the number of collisions grows , and with it the charge transfer . as the charge acquired by the particles is correlated with their size , charge separation occurs too . the system approaches a steady state with an average nonzero number of particles in the domain and an exponentially divergent charge separation , as shown in the inset of figure 4 . this exponential charge growth is limited in nature by electrical discharges , lightning . the total charge separation q displays nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the secondary nucleation rate s. inset : time evolution of q for s 0.1 shows the exponential growth characteristic of all values of s sc . however , for secondary - nucleation rates much greater than sc , there are more and more collisions . the particles undergo more fission into secondary nuclei , and although much charge is produced , it does not separate as well ; charge separation is still exponentially divergent , but the growth rate decreases beyond sc . there is thus an intermediate optimal value of the secondary nucleation rate to produce the greatest charge separation . this critical value sc 1(rc ) is 0.0625 in the simulations ( dashed line in figure 4 ) . a smaller value of rc ( which means a weaker updraft ) requires secondary nucleation to occur more often ( larger sc ) in order to ensure some particles are advected upward ( leading to charge separation ) , while the initial density of particles . controls the collision probability . it is worth mentioning that even in the limit of very high particle density , in which many collisions occur at early stages , charge separation is minimal in the absence of secondary nucleation . earlier work of ours made us suspect that secondary nucleation ought to be important in runaway collisional charging . previously we have shown that the nonlinear feedback effects of secondary nucleation are responsible for chiral symmetry breaking in experiments involving crystallizing a chiral chemical compound from solution . we showed that secondary nuclei in such stirred crystallization experiments are often easily detached whisker or needle crystallites growing from a mother crystal , and a runaway process involving the formation of secondary nuclei leads to complete chiral symmetry breaking . water molecules possess a high electric polarizability ; they are electrical dipoles and can be highly affected by the presence of an external field . during dendrite growth , an electric field can produce an ordering of the molecular dipoles and increase the molecular flow toward the dendrite tip . this increases the growth velocity , decreases the tip radius and disables the generation of side - branches , producing long whiskers . these effects have long been noted and were studied quantitatively by libbrecht and tanusheva , who measured the tip velocity and found that high voltages could multiply the growth rate more than 10-fold . we hypothesized that this dendrite growth mechanism should be involved in promoting secondary nucleation . thus , we undertook laboratory experiments to see whether similarly easily detached forms as in solution crystallization experiments are produced in ice under the influence of an electric field . we employed a fei quanta 200 environmental scanning electron microscope ( esem ) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cold stage to grow ice in situ at low pressures and at temperatures of 90200 k. the microscope was set up so that the cold finger , together with a thermostat , was directly beneath the substrate ( a silicon wafer attached with silver glue ) . we began by evacuating the chamber in the high - vacuum mode of the microscope ( 6 10 pa ) and lowering the substrate to the working temperature . we first scanned the uncovered sample substrate , on which we grew an ice film by switching to low - vacuum mode and opening the water input microvalve at a pressure of 40 pa for some seconds . we found this was the highest pressure at which we could obtain clear images . we closed the microvalve at or before the point when the substrate temperature increases and can not be maintained at the working temperature , following which we switched back to high - vacuum mode and observed the ice growth in situ . in the electron - microscope chamber , a high - voltage electron beam is used for imaging , and as we display in figure 5 , we find that the electric field produces rapid dendrite growth wherever we charge with electrons by imaging . a typical ice morphology seen under these circumstances is of a form intermediate between whiskers and dendrites , which often takes on the aspect of a palm tree ; see figure 5a . as we zoom out ( figure 5b , c ) , we note that the palm forest is found only where we had been imaging ; outside the area of the electron beam , we find a relatively flat film of ice , while within the imaged zones , three in figure 5c , we find faster ice growth and the ice forest . growth in an esem : ( a , b ) at t 170 k , p 40 pa , v 30 kv , an ice the forest displays the morphology intermediate between whiskers and dendrites typically formed with charged ice . ( c ) in an overview , the three zones where we imaged and charged with electrons stand out , showing the increased growth on the background ice film . we had noted such palmlike forms in previous experiments involving growing ice inside an electron microscope , but had not then realized that the electric field was involved in their production . these experiments are necessarily qualititative , being performed within the chamber of an unmodified esem , but we find the results suggestive : owing to their geometry , the breakage of these structures on collision is likely and will lead to the formation of new nucleation centers . such friable morphologies do not only form in ice under electric fields ; snowflakes too have such delicate structures , but an electric field promotes this form of growth . our minimal physical model of a self - replicating granular material shows how secondary nuclei from such growth can lead to runaway charging . these effects may be present in ice on earth , in terrestrial thunderstorms , and in astrophysical ices , in the solar nebula , and in thunderstorms on other planets , some of which , for example , on venus , may involve self - replicating granular materials other than water ice . it is conceivable that this dynamics is involved in the formation of the martian geological structures called razorbacks . while ice is clearly the most quotidian example of a friable self - replicating granular material , one that breaks easily and continues to grow , other such materials can be both sought in different astrophysical environments , and also produced in technological contexts .', 4], ['Generate a summary of lenght 100 words: membrane proteins ( mps ) constitute about 30 of all the proteins encoded in the currently known genomes , and play critical roles in cell signaling , ion transport , and cell - cell communications , as well as assist the folding of other mps ( 1 ) . because of these biological significance , mps represent the most important class of drug targets about 50 of current molecular targets are membrane - bound ( 2 ) . however , only about 2 ( 518 of 25,176 ) of the 3d structures deposited in the protein data bank ( pdb ;

Summary: ', 5], ['Generate a summary of lenght 100 words: membrane proteins ( mps ) constitute about 30 of all the proteins encoded in the currently known genomes , and play critical roles in cell signaling , ion transport , and cell - cell communications , as well as assist the folding of other mps ( 1 ) . because of these biological significance , mps represent the most important class of drug targets about 50 of current molecular targets are membrane - bound ( 2 ) . however , only about 2 ( 518 of 25,176 ) of the 3d structures deposited in the protein data bank ( pdb ; ref . 3 ) are for mps . and the number of high - resolution structures ( from x - ray diffraction and more recently from nmr ) remains even smaller , largely because of the difficulties in crystallizing mps . recently , some new ideas and experimental approaches have been introduced in the area of mp crystallization ( 4 ) , all of which exploit the spontaneous self - assembling properties of lipids and detergent as vesicles ( vesicle - fusion method ) , discoidal micelles ( bicelle method ) , and liquid crystals or mesophases ( in meso or cubic - phase method ) . despite these promising new methods , the current gap between need and supply of mp 3d structures makes prediction algorithms important and essential . mps come in a variety of sizes and shapes , though the available 3d structure principles are far less diverse than those of the globular proteins . from a structural point of view one is the -helix bundle protein , in which one or several -helices span the membrane ; and the other is -barrel protein , in which eight or more antiparallel tm -strands form a closed barrel 5 . 6 . two recent examples 7 . since jhnig and edholm in 1992 presented one of the first methods using secondary structure prediction to build suitable model structures as initial conformations for molecular dynamic studies ( 9 ) , several groups have tried computational approaches to elucidate mp structures . in 1993 , milik and skolnick presented a method based on the combination of a hydropathy scale for the prediction of trans - bilayer fragments with dynamic monte carlo simulation techniques ( 10 ) . in 1994 , taylor et al . adapted some programs originally developed for the prediction of globular protein structures to derive a method for the prediction of integral mp structures ( 11 ) . each step in the method is fully automated , from the initial sequence data bank searches to the final construction of 3d models . consequently , estimates for prediction accuracy are perhaps overly optimistic . here , we summarize recent attempts within the field of computational biology and bioinformatics to predict an mp s structure . most current methods of theoretical mp structure prediction do not actually deal with predicting the 3d structure , but rather try to predict the most likely topology of the protein , that is to say , the in out location of the n and c termini relative to the membrane , and the number and position of transmembrane ( tm ) segments . a high - quality model of secondary structure and topology is a prerequisite for experimental structure - function studies , and can be a starting point for attempts to model the 3d structure before molecular dynamics or simulated annealing simulations . in recent years , various accurate methods because the number of high - resolution structures of -barrel proteins is less than that of the -helix proteins , the neural network has been more frequently adopted in the -strand topology prediction . the details of some methods based on hidden markov models ( hmms ) are listed in table 2 . many secondary structure prediction methods are based on statistical methods , physicochemical methods , sequence pattern maching , and evolutionary conservation ( 12 ) . the main methods for identifing tm helices are on the basis of their hydrophobicity and known minimum length ( at least 15 residues ; ref . membrane propensities were defined by a statistical analysis carried out on a set of 640 tm helices , belonging to 133 mps extracted from swiss - prot ( 14 ) that have experimentally defined topologies . the five widely used prediction methods for predicting the topology of -helix bundle mps are tmhmm ( 15 ) , hmmtop ( 16 ) , memsat ( 17 ) , phdhtm ( 18 ) , and toppred ( 19 ) . tmhmm , hmmtop , and memsat are all based on hmms with 57 types of structural states . toppred was the first topology prediction method that combined hydrophobicity analysis and the positive - inside rule . generally , these sequence - based methods for predicting the number and approximate location of tm helices within mps have about 85 accuracy . in 2003 , karin meln et al . tried to construct useful reliability scores for these methods ( 20 ) . 21 ) algorithm can provide a solution to the problem that non - transmembrane query sequences may give false positive hits ( 20-30 ) in the prediction process . the upgraded and modified version of the das - prediction method , das - tmfilter algorithm , has been distributed ( 22 ) . the new algorithm is designed to make distinction between protein sequences with and without tm helices at a reasonably low rate of false positive prediction ( 1 among 100 unrelated queries ) while the high efficiency of the original algorithm locating tm segments in queries is preserved ( sensitivity of 95 among documented proteins with helical tm regions ) . in 2003 , xia and colleagues presented a new approach , conpredelite ( 23 ) , that can predict the whole topology with accuracies of 98 for prokaryotic and 95 for eukaryotic proteins as they reported . besides the tm helix , another tm segments type is -barrel , which consists of several tm strands . unlike -helical mps , there are no simple low - resolution experiments that yield large amounts of data for -barrel mps . in fact , the overall hydrophobicity for -barrel mps is similar to that of soluble proteins ( 13 ) . gromiha and colleagues combined amino acid preferences for -strands with the surrounding hydrophobicity of the respective residues to predict -strands ( 24 ) . diederichs and colleagues proposed to use a neural network to predict the topology of the bacterial outer membrane -strand proteins and to locate residues along the axes of the pores ( 25 ) . jacoboni and colleagues applied a method combining neural networks and dynamic programming to predict the location of membrane strands ( 26 ) . the authors estimated that their system correctly predicted about 93 of all known membrane strands . more recently , martelli et al . developed a sequence - profile - based hmm model that can predict the topology of -barrel mps cyclicing with 6 types of states ( 27 ) . they reported that the accuracy of per residue of the model was about 83 . lately the following protocol starting from secondary structure prediction and tm segments topology prediction are often used . secondary structure prediction followed by tm segments identification along with prediction of loops connecting the segments , and molecular dynamics or simulated annealing simulations , may be finally used to refine these primal models . during the last refinement step , the protein is often inserted into a water lipid bilayer water or a water n - octane water environment to take into account the presence of the cell membrane . charmm , gromos , amber , and cvff - insight are some widely used force fields in molecular dynamics calculation . the slow dynamics of lipid molecules in the bilayer might bring the difficulties in equilibrating the system ( 28 ) . for globular proteins , the major successful methods for structure prediction include homology modeling , threading , and ab initio folding . along with lucubrating the mechanism of mp folding and increasing the number of high - resolution mp structures , these methods will been applied to the direct prediction of whole mp 3d structures . the question of how the controlled integration of an mp into the lipid bilayer takes place is still not fully worked out , and there are certainly aspects of mp structures that will probably not be fully appreciated until this step has been accomplished . some pursuers educed the viewpoint that the prediction of mp structures from amino acid sequences was , in large measure , a problem of physicochemistry ( 29 ) . physical influences that shape mp structures include interactions of the polypeptide chains with water , bilayer hydrocarbon core , bilayer interfaces , and cofactors . studies on the mechanism of insertion and folding of mps into membranes are relatively rare and have been mostly performed with two model proteins : bacteriorhodopsin ( br ; ref . while br is a representative -helical bundle protein , ompa belongs to the class of -barrel protein . homology modeling constructs structures ( targets ) that are homologous to other protein(s ) whose 3d structure is known ( templates ) . because few high - resolution mp 3d structures are available to be used as templates , and the modeling can be unreliable when the sequence identity between the template and target proteins falls below 20-30 , the applicability of homology modeling is limited . an ab initio method was presented ( 32 ) , whose knowledge - based technique added a membrane potential to the energy terms ( pairwise , solvation , steric , and hydrogen bonding ) . the method is based on the assembly of supersecondary structural fragments taken from a library of highly resolved protein structures using a standard simulated annealing algorithm . results obtained by applying the method to small mps of known 3d structures showed that the method is able to predict , at a reasonable accurate level , both the helix topology and the conformations of these proteins . the structure prediction of membrane proteins still remains an interesting scientific problem . because of the physical difference between mps and gps ( globular proteins ) current segment accuracy of reported algorithms are pretty high ( above 90 ) , while the overall accuracy are still around 50-60 , which gives birth to hand - raising methods to combine the reports from several other algorithms . the lack of both high - resolution and low - resolution experimental data of mp structures makes the algorithm development and their evaluation difficult , but the fact that most mp sequences are used as space blocks to get through the membrane bilayer that has predefined thickness makes the structure prediction of mps simple on functional aspects . new algorithms will emerge and reported algorithms will be refined to give a better answer to this problem .', 5], [\"Generate a summary of lenght 125 words: data for the analysis were collected through structured phone interviews with a national sample of 27 hmos . the surveyed hmos include 15

in their commercial service areas , but were not serving rural medicare risk enrollees as of december 1995 ; this sample was stratified by census region . interview protocols were developed using the literature on hmos and medicare risk contracts , including the 1990 mathematica study , and consisted of open - ended questions and probes regarding the hmo  is decisionmaking , experiences , and future plans regarding medicare risk products in rural areas . at each hmo , one or more senior managers who were knowledgeable about the hmo  is medicare risk product or the hmo  is decision not to offer the product were interviewed . three of the hmos in the risk sample had pre - tax equity and fiscal responsibility act ( tefra ) of 1982 demonstration projects , five hmos began their medicare risk contracts between the mid-1980s and 1991 , and eight hmos signed contracts after 1993 . these hmos range in age from 8 to 51 years , with a median age of 13 years ( table 1 ) . six are mixed - model hmos , seven are individual practice associations ( ipas ) , one is a group model , and one is a staff model . the 11 hmos in the commercial sample are younger than those in the risk sample , and a greater percentage are ipa models ( table 2 ) . only 2 of these plans have more than 100,000 enrollees , compared with 12 of the 15 plans with rural medicare risk enrollees . the percentages of for - profit hmos and nonprofit hmos in the two groups are similar . compared with hmo plans nationally ( interstudy , 1996 ) , the hmos in the risk sample are older , have larger total enrollment , are less likely to have for - profit tax status , and are more likely to be mixed - model hmos . their organizational characteristics resemble those of all hmos with medicare risk contracts ( physician payment review commission and prospective payment assessment commission , 1995 ) . the risk sample hmos represent more than one - fourth of the 50 hmos nationally that were serving at least 100 rural medicare risk enrollees at the end of 1995 . therefore , we are reasonably confident that the study results are generalizable to all hmos that were serving rural medicare risk enrollees when the study was conducted . however , the results may not be fully generalizable to new health plans , e. g. provider - sponsored organizations ( psos ) , that develop to contract with the medicare program on a risk basis in the future . most of the risk sample hmos cited a combination of factors in their decisions to serve rural medicare risk enrollees . these hmos are all well - established plans with large commercial populations , and several indicated that their decision to offer a medicare risk product in rural areas was influenced by their experiences offering commercial products in those areas . seven hmos cited the presence of significant senior populations in some rural areas as a motivating factor for offering the medicare risk product . for six hmos , having an established provider network in rural areas was a major factor . the hmos were especially interested in contracting with major employers with large numbers of retirees in rural areas . one hmo official stated : we wanted to have a well - rounded offering , from a provider and consumer perspective , by covering medicare and medicaid as well as commercial . this hmo added that it did not enter the medicare risk business thinking it would make money . two hmos described hcfa  is requirement that a medicare risk service area be contiguous as a factor in their decisions . two hmos specifically mentioned

role in one hmo  is decision to expand to rural counties . secondary effect ; it chose to serve urban areas and portions of the nearby rural counties just came with them . four hmos described aapcc rates as one of several factors they considered in their decisions to serve rural counties . one hmo selected rural counties where aapcc rates were not outrageously low compared with the urban counties in its service area ; other hmos indicated that they were serving rural areas in spite of low aapcc rates . these hmos balanced low rural aapcc rates with other factors such as capacity in the provider network , provider willingness to work with the plan , the growing number of retirees in some rural areas , and a desire to establish their medicare risk products in advance of the competition . for the commercial sample , aapcc rates emerged as the most important factor in hmos ' decisions not to offer a medicare risk product in rural areas . several hmos described low aapcc rates in rural counties as the only reason why they are not offering a medicare risk product in the rural portions of their commercial service areas . other hmos cited a combination of factors , including low aapcc rates , inability to develop a sufficient provider network , and small numbers of medicare beneficiaries . these findings are in accord with research indicating that the rural counties currently served by medicare risk hmos have significantly larger populations , higher population density , and higher aapcc rates , and are more likely to be located adjacent to urban areas , compared with rural counties not served by medicare risk hmos ( moscovice , casey , and krein , 1998 ) . most of the risk sample hmos cited a combination of factors in their decisions to serve rural medicare risk enrollees . these hmos are all well - established plans with large commercial populations , and several indicated that their decision to offer a medicare risk product in rural areas was influenced by their experiences offering commercial products in those areas . seven hmos cited the presence of significant senior populations in some rural areas as a motivating factor for offering the medicare risk product . for six hmos , having an established provider network in rural areas was a major factor . the hmos were especially interested in contracting with major employers with large numbers of retirees in rural areas . one hmo official stated : we wanted to have a well - rounded offering , from a provider and consumer perspective , by covering medicare and medicaid as well as commercial . this hmo added that it did not enter the medicare risk business thinking it would make money . two hmos described hcfa  is requirement that a medicare risk service area be contiguous as a factor in their decisions . two hmos specifically mentioned competition from other hmos in rural areas as a motivating force for serving rural medicare enrollees . geographic necessity , i. e. the desire to expand in a state that is mostly rural , played a role in one hmo  is decision to expand to rural counties . secondary effect ; it chose to serve urban areas and portions of the nearby rural

to be located adjacent to urban areas , compared with rural counties not served by medicare risk hmos ( moscovice , casey , and krein , 1998 ) . the 15 hmos in the rural sample have rural medicare service areas that range in size from 1 county to 20 counties , with a median of 5 rural counties . twelve of these hmos currently have a rural medicare service area that is smaller than their rural commercial service area . the differences between the hmos ' medicare and commercial service areas range from one county to the majority of rural counties in a state . these hmos most frequently cited low aapcc rates and difficulty contracting with providers in some counties as reasons for selective exclusion of rural counties from their medicare service areas . five of the 15 risk sample hmos and 3 of the 11 commercial sample hmos identified hcfa  is access standards ( which require that enrollees have access to primary and specialty care within certain distance or travel times ) as federal requirements that are more difficult for the hmo to meet in rural areas . monopolies in some rural counties ( e. g. counties with a single ipa or hospital that refuses to negotiate a capitated contract ) make it more difficult to meet the access standards . the risk sample hmos reported using a variety of reimbursement methods for their medicare risk products , depending on the hmo model type , its ability to negotiate capitated contracts , andor the volume of medicare risk patients . most frequently , these hmos pay some or all rural physicians on a discounted fee - for - service ( ffs ) basis , while capitating urban physicians . the risk sample hmos reported varying degrees of competition from other hmos in their rural medicare risk service areas . most of the hmos , however , reported that competition is limited to one or two other medicare risk plans in a portion of their rural service areas , in contrast to the significant competition that exists in many urban areas . for a few hmos , competition in their rural service areas is primarily in the form of medicare cost andor supplemental products . five hmos did not know whether the utilization patterns of their rural medicare risk enrollees differ from those of urban enrollees . for most of these hmos , rural enrollees comprise a small percentage of their medicare risk enrollees , and they have not examined rural utilization patterns separately . a few hmos have not observed any differences in rural and urban utilization patterns while others , including two hmos with large numbers of rural enrollees , reported that utilization has been higher in rural areas . of the 15 hmos with rural medicare risk enrollees , 8 hmos were able to differentiate between the financial experience of their medicare risk product in rural areas and in urban areas . five of these eight hmos said their medicare risk products were unprofitable in rural areas ( and either profitable or breaking even in urban areas ) , while two hmos said they were breaking even in rural areas and making a profit in urban areas . one hmo reported that its financial experience in both urban and rural areas has been moderately positive . one hmo did not describe its financial experience with the medicare risk product , and six hmos described their overall financial experience without distinguishing between rural and urban areas . two of these hmos said their medicare risk products were unprofitable overall , two hmos said they were breaking even , and two reported that their financial experience varied from county to county within their service area . in addition , the interviewed hmo that dropped its medicare risk contract did so because both the hmo and the rural clinic , its only provider in the area , were experiencing financial losses under the risk contract . no clear relationship emerged between the hmos ' financial experience with medicare risk products in rural areas and either the length of time the hmo has offered the product or the number of rural enrollees . the hmos that reported unprofitable medicare risk products in rural areas include both hmos that have had these products for several years and hmos that began offering them more recently . they also include some hmos with large numbers of rural medicare risk enrollees , as well as hmos with relatively fewer rural medicare risk enrollees . hmos with low rural aapcc rates ( less than $ 375 ) were more likely to say their medicare risk products are losing money in rural areas , while those with moderate rural rates ( $ 375 to $ 499 ) were more likely to say they are breaking even or profitable . four of the 15 hmos with medicare risk products in rural areas plan to expand their rural medicare service areas in the near future . one of these hmos plans to add two rural counties , and the other three hmos plan to add several rural counties . likely to add one rural county , while another hmo will only add medicare enrollees from nearby rural areas who obtain care in urban areas . four hmos have no plans to expand their rural medicare service areas ; one of these hmos plans to drop some rural counties unless rates increase or contracting requirements change . for three hmos , future rural expansion depends on aapcc changes ; one of these hmos is also evaluating the status of some rural counties in its current service area . two hmos may expand their medicare risk service areas in the future as they expand their commercial service areas . among the group of hmos not currently serving rural medicare risk enrollees , one of the two hmos with urban medicare risk enrollees plans to serve rural enrollees in the future , and the other plans to serve them if its rural aapcc rates increase . three hmos in the commercial sample are considering medicare risk contracts , but have not decided whether to submit applications or which counties would be in their service areas . six hmos have no plans to serve rural medicare risk enrollees in the near future . two of these hmos have submitted medicare risk applications for urban service areas , and another is preparing such an application . one hmo applied for a medicare cost contract ; a second was considering a medicare cost or medicare select product , and a third was considering a traditional medicare supplemental product . four of the 15 hmos with medicare risk products in rural areas plan to expand their rural medicare service areas in the near future . one of these hmos plans to add two rural counties , and the other three hmos plan to add several rural counties . likely to add one rural county , while another hmo will only add medicare enrollees from nearby rural areas who obtain care in urban areas . four hmos have no plans to expand their rural medicare service areas ; one of these hmos plans to drop some rural counties unless rates increase or contracting requirements change . for three hmos , future rural expansion depends on aapcc changes ; one of these hmos is also evaluating the status of some rural counties in its current service area . two hmos may expand their medicare risk service areas in the future as they expand their commercial service areas . among the group of hmos not currently serving rural medicare risk enrollees , one of the two hmos with urban medicare risk enrollees plans to serve rural enrollees in the future , and the other plans to serve them if its rural aapcc rates increase . three hmos in the commercial sample are considering medicare risk contracts , but have not decided whether to submit applications or which counties would be in their service areas . six hmos have no plans to serve rural medicare risk enrollees in the near future . two of these hmos have submitted medicare risk applications for urban service areas , and another is preparing such an application . one hmo applied for a medicare cost contract ; a second was considering a medicare cost or medicare select product , and a third was considering a traditional medicare supplemental product . the results summarized in this article underscore the importance of aapcc rates as a factor in hmos ' decisions to offer medicare risk products in rural areas , but also identify several other factors that influence these decisions , including the hmo  is experience with commercial hmo products in rural areas , whether the hmo has an established rural provider network ( or believes it can successfully develop one ) , employer demand for retiree coverage , the presence of sufficiently large senior populations , the hmo  is corporate mission , contiguous service area requirements , and competition from other hmos . this article also shows that aapcc rates and provider network considerations are important factors in decisions made by a number of hmos to exclude rural counties in their commercial service areas from their medicare risk contract service areas . these results suggest that the changes in the aapcc payment methodology are most likely to affect the willingness of two groups of hmos to serve rural medicare risk enrollees . the first group is hmos that have excluded rural counties in their commercial service areas from their medicare risk contract service areas primarily because of low aapcc rates . the second group includes hmos that serve rural commercial populations , but do not offer a rural medicare risk product because of low aapcc rates in those rural counties . hmos that are serving rural medicare risk enrollees unintentionally or only at the hmos ' urban facilities appear unlikely to increase the number of rural enrollees they serve as a result of the aapcc changes . increases in rural aapcc rates will not directly affect other factors cited by some hmos as disincentives to medicare risk product development in rural areas . these include small numbers of rural medicare beneficiaries or the unwillingness of rural providers to contract with the hmo on a capitated basis . however , the aapcc changes may indirectly reduce some of these barriers . for example , to the extent that increased aapcc rates allow hmos to offer rural physicians , hospitals , and other providers more favorable reimbursement , the aapcc changes may encourage previously reluctant rural providers to participate in hmo provider networks . alternatively , some of these rural providers may be motivated by increased aapcc rates and the potential regulatory flexibility of federal pso standards to develop psos , either in competition with hmos or as joint ventures with hmos or insurance companies . although the majority of medicare risk enrollees are individuals , this study indicates that large employers seeking hmo coverage for retirees now play a growing role in encouraging hmos to offer medicare risk products in some rural areas . this article also suggests that competition in a few medicare risk markets is motivating some hmos to expand their medicare risk service areas to include rural counties . in another sign of potential near - term growth in the rural medicare risk contract market , several hmos described a proposed strategy of initially developing their medicare risk product in urban areas where aapcc rates are higher and contracting with providers is easier , and then expanding to rural areas . a number of hmos , however , reported financial losses on their rural medicare risk products , and nearly all of the hmos currently serving rural medicare risk enrollees indicated that their financial experience in rural areas has been less positive than in urban areas . the for - profit hmos interviewed have clear expectations that their medicare risk products will be profitable or will not be continued . a number of the non - profit hmos suggested that they did not expect to make money on a rural medicare risk product , however , they acknowledged the need to break even over the long term . some indemnity insurers with substantial numbers of rural medicare beneficiaries in supplemental products operate affiliated hmos and are encouraging their rural commercial populations to move to managed care . the future of medicare risk contracting in rural areas may depend in part on whether these organizations decide to offer medicare risk products through affiliated hmos , and the degree to which they encourage their medicare supplemental subscribers to move to managed care . the success of medicare risk contracting in rural areas also will depend on whether increased aapcc rates allow hmos to offer rural enrollees the type of medicare risk products that have competed successfully with medicare supplemental products in higher aapcc urban markets , i. e. products with zero premiums or low premiums compared with supplemental products , as well as additional benefits such as prescription coverage . Summary: \", 6], [\"Generate a summary of lenght 125 words: data for the analysis were collected through structured phone interviews with a national sample of 27 hmos . the surveyed hmos include 15 hmos currently serving rural medicare risk enrollees , 1 hmo that recently dropped its medicare risk contract to serve rural enrollees , and 11 hmos that have commercial enrollees in 5 or more rural counties , but no rural medicare risk enrollees . the study also analyzed secondary data on hmo characteristics , medicare risk enrollment , and aapcc rates . the risk sample consisted of hmos serving 100 or more rural medicare risk enrollees as of december 1995 , stratified by the number of rural medicare risk enrollees . the commercial sample consisted of hmos that had five or more rural counties in their commercial service areas , but were not serving rural medicare risk enrollees as of december 1995 ; this sample was stratified by census region . interview protocols were developed using the literature on hmos and medicare risk contracts , including the 1990 mathematica study , and consisted of open - ended questions and probes regarding the hmo  is decisionmaking , experiences , and future plans regarding medicare risk products in rural areas . at each hmo , one or more senior managers who were knowledgeable about the hmo  is medicare risk product or the hmo  is decision not to offer the product were interviewed . three of the hmos in the risk sample had pre - tax equity and fiscal responsibility act ( tefra ) of 1982 demonstration projects , five hmos began their medicare risk contracts between the mid-1980s and 1991 , and eight hmos signed contracts after 1993 . these hmos range in age from 8 to 51 years , with a median age of 13 years ( table 1 ) . six are mixed - model hmos , seven are individual practice associations ( ipas ) , one is a group model , and one is a staff model . the 11 hmos in the commercial sample are younger than those in the risk sample , and a greater percentage are ipa models ( table 2 ) . only 2 of these plans have more than 100,000 enrollees , compared with 12 of the 15 plans with rural medicare risk enrollees . the percentages of for - profit hmos and nonprofit hmos in the two groups are similar . compared with hmo plans nationally ( interstudy , 1996 ) , the hmos in the risk sample are older , have larger total enrollment , are less likely to have for - profit tax status , and are more likely to be mixed - model hmos . their organizational characteristics resemble those of all hmos with medicare risk contracts ( physician payment review commission and prospective payment assessment commission , 1995 ) . the risk sample hmos represent more than one - fourth of the 50 hmos nationally that were serving at least 100 rural medicare risk enrollees at the end of 1995 . therefore , we are reasonably confident that the study results are generalizable to all hmos that were serving rural medicare risk enrollees when the study was conducted . however , the results may not be fully generalizable to new health plans , e. g. provider - sponsored organizations ( psos ) , that develop to contract with the medicare program on a risk basis in the future . most of the risk sample hmos cited a combination of factors in their decisions to serve rural medicare risk enrollees . these hmos are all well - established plans with large commercial populations , and several indicated that their decision to offer a medicare risk product in rural areas was influenced by their experiences offering commercial products in those areas . seven hmos cited the presence of significant senior populations in some rural areas as a motivating factor for offering the medicare risk product . for six hmos , having an established

risk business thinking it would make money . two hmos described hcfa  is requirement that a medicare risk service area be contiguous as a factor in their decisions . two hmos specifically mentioned competition from other hmos in rural areas as a motivating force for serving rural medicare enrollees . geographic necessity , i. e. the desire to expand in a state that is mostly rural , played a role in one hmo  is decision to expand to rural counties . secondary effect ; it chose to serve urban areas and portions of the nearby rural counties just came with them . four hmos described aapcc rates as one of several factors they considered in their decisions to serve rural counties . one hmo selected rural counties where aapcc rates were not outrageously low compared with the urban counties in its service area ; other hmos indicated that they were serving rural areas in spite of low aapcc rates . these hmos balanced low rural aapcc rates with other factors such as capacity in the provider network , provider willingness to work with the plan , the growing number of retirees in some rural areas , and a desire to establish their medicare risk products in advance of the competition . for the commercial sample , aapcc rates emerged as the most important factor in hmos ' decisions not to offer a medicare risk product in rural areas . several hmos described low aapcc rates in rural counties as the only reason why they are not offering a medicare risk product in the rural portions of their commercial service areas . other hmos cited a combination of factors , including low aapcc rates , inability to develop a sufficient provider network , and small numbers of medicare beneficiaries . these findings are in accord with research indicating that the rural counties currently served by medicare risk hmos have significantly larger populations , higher population density , and higher aapcc rates , and are more likely to be located adjacent to urban areas ,

they encourage their medicare supplemental subscribers to move to managed care . the success of medicare risk contracting in rural areas also will depend on whether increased aapcc rates allow hmos to offer rural enrollees the type of medicare risk products that have competed successfully with medicare supplemental products in higher aapcc urban markets , i. e. products with zero premiums or low premiums compared with supplemental products , as well as additional benefits such as prescription coverage .\", 6], ['Generate a summary of lenght 150 words: most of the reported cases have been

artery , gastroduodenal artery , and splenic artery . the follow - up ct scan , obtained 3 months after the procedure , showed a complete disappearance of the dissecting aneurysm . spontaneous dissection of the celiac artery , which is not associated with aortic dissection , is extremely rare . approximately one half of the patients with celiac artery dissection are asymptomatic , due to a good collateral flow , via the superior mesenteric artery ( 3 ) . the symptoms are usually non - specific epigastric pain or post - prandial abdominal pain . these symptoms are considered to be the result of the dissection itself , or to ischemic signs of the abdominal organ ( 4 ) . however , various clinical presentations , such as liver ischemia , splenic infarction , may occur according to the involvement of the branch vessels , and life threatening hemorrhage due to a rupture of the aneurysm ( 1 , 4 ) . the initial diagnosis of the visceral artery dissection is rarely established by symptoms . this disease entity is found incidentally during imaging studies for the purpose of evaluating other symptoms . there have been reported cases in which the ct findings of isolated dissection of the celiac artery were described ( 4 , 5 ) . the intimal flap with double lumen , thrombosis of false lumen or intramural hematoma , enlarged involved vessels were the findings of visceral artery dissection . infiltration of the fat surrounding the affected vessel is a well - known secondary sign of acute spontaneous dissection of a visceral artery . complications of the celiac artery dissection include hemorrhage or ischemic change of the distal organs , propagation of dissection into adjacent vessels , expansion of a false lumen , and the development of an aneurysm . the hepatic artery aneurysm could be presented as a complication of the celiac artery dissection . expansion of a false lumen may cause either a rupture or poor perfusion to the supplied organ , secondary to the mechanical compression of the true lumen flow ( 6 ) . however , the inability to predict either regression or expansion of a false lumen mandates close , life - long follow - up . the management of celiac artery dissection depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient , response to conservative treatment , and development of complications ( ischemia or hemorrhage ) . in asymptomatic stable dissection , current treatment recommendations are conservative treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents under close observation to prevent thromboembolic complications . blood pressure control is necessary to minimize the progression of a dissection ( 4 , 5 ) . the indications for surgical or endovascular treatment include visceral ischemia , rupture of the dissection , progressing aneurysm ( 1 , 2 , 6 - 8 ) . in the era of improved radiologic intervention , percutaneous endovascular treatment has been used as a surgical alternative with increasing frequency for the management of complicated splanchnic artery dissection because of its less invasiveness . the specific application of any interventional technique should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient , because each technique offers different advantages and disadvantages ( 6 - 8 ) . ( 6 ) reported placement of a bare metal stent in a patient with celiac artery dissection as a treatment of poor perfusion secondary to mechanical compression of the true lumen by an expansion of the false lumen , following a failed conservative treatment . but , there was no evidence of a rupture in that case . in our cases , dissection of the celiac artery resulted in a rupture of aneurysm with decreased hemoglobin level in the first case , and progressing aneurysm with high risk of rupture in the second case . conservative treatment , including anticoagulation or placement of a bare stent , was not amenable to treat or prevent bleeding in our cases because these therapies could not limit the aneurysm . 8) reported isolated dissecting aneurysm of the celiac artery , extending into the proper hepatic artery that was successfully treated by transcatheter arterial embolization . fortunately , in this reported case , intrahepatic branches were visualized after embolization through collateral pathways of the pancreatic arcade and epicholedochal arterial plexus from the superior mesenteric artery and dorsal pancreatic artery . however , proper collateral flow is essential for the use of transcatheter arterial embolization to treat a dissecting celiac artery to avoid organ infarction . therefore , a stent - graft could be considered to control the bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm without the inadvertent development of complications caused by arterial embolization in poor collateral channels . several reports have suggested the stent - graft as a valid alternative endovascular treatment for ruptured sma dissection or celiac artery aneurysm ( 9 , 10 ) . a stent - graft that better preserves the distal flow might provide a safe , efficacious alternative to coil or plug embolization . in our cases , the involved vessels showed a smooth curvature to allow an easy navigation of a stent graft . in the first case , the patient had experienced a previous dissection of the superior mesenteric artery without complications . in addition , he had been treated with anticoagulant and hypertensive medication . the patient had discontinued anticoagulation after 6 months , and no serious complications concerning a superior mesenteric artery dissection was noted on a follow - up ct angiogram . the patient had stopped his hypertension medication arbitrarily . in addition , 10 months later , a ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the celiac artery developed with a concomitant decrease in hemoglobin . most likely , arbitrary discontinuation of medication could explain the episode of celiac artery dissection . we successfully treated the dissecting aneurysm of the celiac artery that had ruptured with the retroperitoneal hematoma by the use of a stent graft . in the second case , although the urgent complication had not been noticed , the progressive enlargement of the aneurysm is at the greatest risk from rupturing . the patient was managed successfully with the placement of a stent graft . to our knowledge , we are reporting the first case of a spontaneous celiac artery dissection treated with a stent graft . percutaneous stent graft placement for the treatment of complicated spontaneous dissection of celiac artery is safe and feasible . however , studies with a large group of patients and long - term follow - up will be needed to validate this procedure .

eclampsia , anemia , and infection in the pregnant chronic dialysis patient are high . however , our findings suggest that with careful , close , and effective monitoring preoperatively and intraoperatively , spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis . fertility is reduced in patients with renal disease , so pregnancy in patients with end - stage renal failure is uncommon . however , confortini et al in 1971 reported the first case of a 35-year - old end - stage renal failure patient on hemodialysis ( hd ) who achieved a full - term pregnancy.1 the major issues to be dealt with in this type of patient are the possible complications of pregnancy , including onset or exacerbation of systemic arterial hypertension which may evolve into pre - eclampsia or even eclampsia , premature delivery , or failure of the fetus to grow . another important point to define is that of full - term pregnancy in patients on dialysis.2 the placenta usually implants in the upper uterine segment . however , in some cases , it implants in the lower uterine segment , either covering the internal cervical os , or lying in close proximity to it . this abnormal implantation into the lower segment , called placenta previa , is an important cause of bleeding in the second half of pregnancy and during labor , and is associated with significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and occasionally mortality.3 there are many reports outlining the safe and successful use of peripheral regional blocks in dialysis - dependent patients if there is no platelet dysfunction or coagulation abnormality . in fact , peripheral regional anesthesia techniques have been used in patients with chronic renal failure ( crf ) for the creation of arteriovenous fistulae . in this paper we share our experience of spinal anesthesia in a pregnant woman with crf on dialysis and needing an emergency cesarean section due to placenta previa . a 31-year - old woman with seven gravidas , four paras , two abortions , and three live children was referred to us at 37 weeks and five days gestation . she had suffered from crf since the age of 29 years , and had been undergoing hemodialysis three times per week . the patient had had a medical abortion one year earlier when she was five months pregnant due to an intrauterine ex - fetus that developed secondary to her renal disease and the patient was recommended not to become pregnant again . having noticed the current pregnancy too late , the patient was then undergoing four hours of dialysis three times a week , and increased to four hours per day for the previous seven months . one hour after her last dialysis , she was hospitalized in gynecology services due to vaginal bleeding and cramps . the patient was being monitored for delivery and upon an increase in the amount of vaginal bleeding and detection of placenta previa during ultrasonographic examination , it was decided to perform an emergency cesarean section . preoperative laboratory values for the patient are summarized in the table . in the preoperative preparation room , central venous catheterization was performed under local anesthesia via the right internal jugular vein . invasive arterial catheterization was performed from the right radial artery ( because an arteriovenous fistula was being used for dialysis on the left side ) . the patient had been taking methyldopa as an antihypertensive during the preoperative period but had severe hypertension at presentation ( 180110 mmhg ) , so nitroglycerin infusion was started . her activated partial thromboplastin time being normal ( table 1 ) , six hours having elapsed since her last dialysis ( ie , the dialysis - dependent antiaggregant effect having receded ) , and considering the risks of anesthesia , it was decided to use spinal anesthesia in view of its additional antihypertensive effect . spinal anesthesia with 8 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine was successfully performed using a 27-gauge spinal needle at the l34 intervertebral space in the sitting position . spinal anesthesia level having reached the t5 and t6 dermatomes , the operation was started at the third minute . a 2220 g baby with an apgar score of 6 in one minute and 8 in five minutes was delivered four minutes after the beginning of surgery . invasive blood pressure ( bp ) , electrocardiography ( ecg ) , heart rate ( hr ) , and pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) were monitored during surgery . hypotension , probably related to sympathetic blockage , developed following spinal anesthesia , so the nitroglycerin infusion was terminated without the need for sympathomimetic medication . thereafter , the patient was taken to the intensive care unit ( icu ) with a bp of 11971 mmhg , a hr of 83 beats per minute , and a sensory spinal anesthesia level at the t9 and t10 dermatomes . during the operation , the patient was not given any liquids other than 1 u of erythrocyte suspension due to her anemia . she was given an additional 2 u of erythrocyte suspension while she was kept in the icu . she recovered without any problems , returned to regular hemodialysis on the first postoperative day , and was discharged from the hospital four days after the operation after adjustment of her antihypertensive therapy and on a dialysis program of four - hourly sessions three days a week . clinical assessment on the day of discharge revealed no complications of spinal anesthesia , such as headache , nausea , change in bp ( in particular , hypotension ) or neurological deficit . meanwhile , the baby was taken for ventilator treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress syndrome . having been treated for abo isoimmunization and neonatal jaundice , the baby was discharged from hospital 32 days after delivery . childbearing is an important issue in women with renal disease.4 although not common , pregnancy in chronic dialysis patients does occur . in fact , the percentage of successful pregnancies in women on chronic dialysis may be increasing.5 however , pregnancy has generally been regarded as very risky in these women.4 maternal complications associated with crf include pre - eclampsia , worsening renal function , preterm delivery , anemia , chronic hypertension , and cesarean delivery.6 hypertension is the most common life - threatening problem in these patients.4 in preparation for elective surgery , patients with crf should receive dialysis the day before the operation . this is essential to achieve a volume status as close to normovolemic as possible , to allow the patient to tolerate fluid loads associated with surgery , and to obtain normal electrolyte concentrations . otherwise , patients have to be managed medically and receive dialysis after the operation.7 our patient had to be operated on six hours after her last dialysis , at which time her volume and electrolyte balance could not be fully established . the preoperative evaluation of the patient with crf should focus on the comorbidities associated with kidney disease and on the signs and symptoms of uremia , fluid overload , and inadequate dialysis . laboratory studies should be aimed at assessing electrolyte concentrations , acid - base status , urea and creatinine levels , hematocrit , platelet count , and coagulation.7 blood gas values were also monitored in our patient as part of her preoperative laboratory examination . particular attention was paid to serum bicarbonate levels , which were in the 1820 meq l range.8 electrolytes should not be measured immediately after dialysis due to incomplete equilibration between plasma and intracellular fluids . potassium levels above 5.5 meq l are usually considered a contraindication to elective surgery because tissue trauma and cell death can cause potassium to increase to life - threatening levels . an ecg is usually obtained as well to screen for changes caused by electrolyte abnormalities.7 no indications of hyperkalemia were observed in our patient s laboratory data or on her ecg . platelet dysfunction is not related to a low platelet count , and can be detected only by the bleeding time , measured as the time to cessation of hemorrhage after a standardized skin incision.9 however , this test seems to have a limited predictive value for clinical bleeding and is not commonly used . patients who are receiving adequate dialysis are less likely to have significant platelet dysfunction and their risk of bleeding should not be excessive.7 control of anemia is important because this is a significant cause of left ventricular hypertrophy , heart failure , and angina . a hemoglobin of 11 to 12 g dl is considered optimal,10 and this value is also used as a target before surgery , although this practice is not supported by clinical evidence . correction of anemia also helps to improve the platelet dysfunction associated with renal failure.11 our patient was given 1 u of erythrocyte suspension during the operation and 2 u after the operation due to the presence of anemia ( see table ) . she was also given erythropoietin , and was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day with an acceptable hemoglobin value . if fluid balance is likely to be a problem , central venous monitoring may be useful , but the need for invasive arterial monitoring should be considered carefully before potentially damaging an artery that may be used later to form an arteriovenous fistula . when positioning patients for surgery , care should be taken to protect shunts or fistulae.12 delayed gastric emptying may increase the risk of aspiration during general anesthesia . if anticoagulants have been used during hemodialysis , at least six hours should elapse before siting a regional block . it is wise to confirm that clotting is normal by checking the activated partial thromboplastin time . when performing a block it is essential to use aseptic technique . presence of any peripheral neuropathy should be documented if regional blocks are to be used.12 intravenous access is usually difficult in patients with crf , and central venous access is often needed . the veins and arteries of the nondominant upper extremity should be spared from vascular cannulation , because they may be needed for dialysis access in the future . subclavian vein cannulation should also be avoided because this procedure is frequently complicated by thrombosis , which compromises dialysis access . therefore , we opted to do central venous cannulation via the internal jugular vein in our patient . we also carried out invasive arterial monitoring via the right radial artery because there was an arteriovenous fistula on the left side for dialysis . during all these procedures , we were extremely careful to maintain sterile conditions due to the risk of infection in this type of patient . the choice of hemodynamic monitoring technique should be based on the history and characteristics of the individual patient and should be directed towards specific hemodynamic goals . patients with renal diseases undergoing high - risk procedures often need invasive hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central venous catheters.7 we considered it appropriate to carry out preoperative arterial and venous monitoring in view of our patient s clinical condition ( ie , anemia , dialysis six hours earlier , and severe hypertension , along with normal bleeding tests ) . hypertension in crf patients is usually volume - dependent and responds to adequate dialysis , but most patients will also require pharmacologic therapy . current recommendations for long - term crf management set a bp goal of lower than 13080 mmhg.13 preoperative bp in our patient was high ( 180110 mmhg ) . nitroglycerin infusion was started at the initiation of invasive arterial monitoring , and the infusion rate was adjusted ( 0.251.0 g kg min ) until the target bp ( 13080 mmhg ) was reached . nitroglycerin infusion was preferred because of its rapid onset and offset , its cardiac protective effect , its lack of vasodilatory properties , and its low risk to the baby . improvements in dialysis and medical treatment have increased the number of dialysis - dependent crf patients being considered for surgery , including obstetric procedures . in patients with crf necessitating dialysis , mortality rates of 4 to 10 have been reported , with morbidity rates approaching 50.14 this increased rate of complications is probably due to the low renal reserve of patients with crf and their reduced ability to respond to the stress , fluid load , and tissue trauma caused by surgery . however , additional morbidity is created by organ dysfunction and the coexisting diseases frequently encountered in these patients . pregnancy adds further risks , including pre - eclampsia , polyhydramnios , intrauterine growth retardation , preterm delivery , low birth weight , and the potential for a stillbirth . we believe that pregnant crf patients requiring dialysis can be urgently and safely operated on using a careful anesthesia method after a detailed renal and hematological preoperative assessment and rapid but detailed preparation . Summary: ', 8], ['Generate a summary of lenght 175 words: a 31-year - old multiparous turkish woman was scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia at 37 weeks and five days gestation because of hemorrhage due to secondary placenta previa . invasive blood pressure , central venous pressure , and heart rate were stable during the surgery . rates of maternal hypertension , pre - eclampsia , anemia , and infection in the pregnant chronic dialysis patient are high . however , our findings suggest that with careful , close , and effective monitoring preoperatively and intraoperatively , spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis . fertility is reduced in patients with renal disease , so pregnancy in patients with end - stage renal failure is uncommon . however , confortini et al in 1971 reported the first case of a 35-year - old end - stage renal failure patient on hemodialysis ( hd ) who achieved a full - term pregnancy.1 the major issues to be dealt with in this type of patient are the possible complications of pregnancy , including onset or exacerbation of systemic arterial hypertension which may evolve into pre - eclampsia or even eclampsia , premature delivery , or failure of the fetus to grow . another important point to define is that of full - term pregnancy in patients on dialysis.2 the placenta usually implants in the upper uterine segment . however , in some cases , it implants in the lower uterine segment , either covering the internal cervical os , or lying in close proximity to it . this abnormal implantation into the lower segment , called placenta previa , is an important cause of bleeding in the second half of pregnancy and during labor , and is associated with significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and occasionally mortality.3 there are many reports outlining the safe and successful use of peripheral regional blocks in dialysis - dependent patients if there is no platelet dysfunction or coagulation abnormality . in fact , peripheral regional anesthesia techniques have been used in patients with chronic renal failure ( crf ) for the creation of arteriovenous fistulae . in this paper we share our experience of spinal anesthesia in a pregnant woman with crf on dialysis and needing an emergency cesarean section due to placenta previa . a 31-year -

patient scored 2 points on the diagnostic criteria scale for acute druginduced hepatic injury established by digestive disease week japan ( ddwj ) 8 , we believed that druginduced hepatic injury seemed unlikely . according to her clinical course and the international diagnostic criteria for aih 1 , she was finally diagnosed with recovery from fulminant liver failure induced by acuteonset aih , likely type 1 aih . a nationwide survey of patients with fulminant hepatitis and lateonset hepatic failure in japan revealed that outcomes were especially poor in aih patients ( the survival rate was 17.1 without liver transplantation ) 9 . as this patient was older than 75 years and repeatedly developed stage 2 hepatic encephalopathy , we believed that she had poor prognosis . although this patient might have benefitted from corticosteroids and plasma exchange at the early stage of fulminant aih , there is a little evidence for the efficacy of these treatments 6 , 10 . although this patient recovered from fulminant liver failure due to aih , she developed suppurative inflammation of the hip joint due to mssa and developed a right rib tumor due to actinomyces . actinomycosis occurs in the cervicofacial ( 6070 ) , abdominal ( 2040 ) , and thoracic ( 920 ) areas . risk factors of actinomycosis are poor oral hygiene resulting in tooth decay , chronic lung disease , alcoholism , and other disorders resulting in reduced immunocompetence 7 . in the present case , immunosuppression due to corticosteroids might have contributed to the development of the right rib actinomycosis . however , the frequency of actinomycosis development secondary to the use of corticosteroid is unclear . actinomyces are part of the normal oral flora and colonize the human digestive tract 7 , 13 , 14 . although the aspiration of saliva containing actinomyces is considered to be responsible for cases of pulmonary actinomycosis , the right rib actinomycosis in this patient might have occurred via hematogenous spread , as there was no invasion from the right lung . this immunocompromised patient might have also developed hip infection due to hematogenous spread of mssa . the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis is difficult , and the differential diagnosis includes pulmonary malignancy 7 , 13 , 14 . thus , the diagnosis of actinomycosis depends on growth of the bacteria in culture and the discovery of sulfur granules in the pathologic specimen . in this patient , when treating patients with fulminant liver failure due to aih , the possibility of such rare occurrences should be kept in mind . in conclusion , this report described an interesting case of an osteolytic lesion secondary to actinomycosis after fulminant liver failure induced by aih .', 9], ['Summarise this text in 1 sentence: root canal treatment is an effective , less invasive and ideal treatment modality for pulpally involved tooth and salvaging it from extraction . cleaning , shaping and three dimensional obturation of root canal system are essential steps in root canal treatment . the bacteria impervious seal that is essential for success is provided by the root canal sealer and obturation

pulpotomy , apexification and as root end filling material . recently , it is finding application as a root canal sealer and as obturation material . when used as a root canal sealer , mta has the ability to regenerate periodontal ligament and form cementum in the root canal space and accessory canals , thus closing the leeway spaces that can result in the treatment failure . more recently , sealers based on mta have been introduced and found to have good sealing ability and higher push - out bond strengths . in addition , sealers based on mta demonstrated apatite - like deposits in contact with physiological solutions and a biocompatibility similar to mta . a sealer of good working consistency could be developed by mixing mta with adequate quantities of water - soluble polymer . epoxy resin sealers like ah plus was found to bond better to the core obturation material and root dentine . they have the advantages such as less shrinkage , high radio opacity , low solubility , better periapical repair and biocompatibility . studies have evaluated the success of root canal treatment , the incidence of pain and healing ability and many other aspects of the root canal sealers both in vivo and in vitro . evaluation of post - operative pain with visual analogue scale ( vas ) , periapical healing with periapical index ( pai ) are widely used methods and morphometric evaluation with vixwin pro digital image analysis software is a new , reliable and accurate technique . zinc oxide eugenol is an efficient and proven root canal sealer while epoxy resin has equivalent properties to compete with it . this study was done to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of mta or epoxy resin as a root canal sealers compared to zinc oxide eugenol sealer using gutta - percha as the obturating material in teeth with periapical radiolucency . this study was conducted in patients in an age group of 18 - 50 years with teeth indicated for root canal treatment . teeth with calcified canals , retreatment cases , pregnant patients , systemic diseases and lactating mothers were excluded . the 45 teeth indicated for root canal treatment were allotted into three groups with 15 teeth in each group . the cases were assigned into any one of the following groups : group 1 : zinc oxide eugenol ( tubliseal ) as root canal sealer ( n 15)group 2 : epoxy resin ( ah plus ) as root canal sealer ( n 15)group 3 : mta ( proroot mta ) as root canal sealer ( n 15 ) . group 1 : zinc oxide eugenol ( tubliseal ) as root canal sealer ( n 15 ) group 2 : epoxy resin ( ah plus ) as

was prepared with access preparation kit ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) . after irrigation with 2.5 sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) ( prime dental products , thane , india ) , a k - file of appropriate size was introduced in the root canal and working length was verified with propex ii apex locator ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) . this was confirmed by taking a radiograph using parallel cone technique with the help of a film positioning device ( endoray ii , densply rinn . cleaning and shaping was done with k - files ( sybron endo , orange , ca ) and protaper rotary system ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) for all the teeth . 2.5 naocl , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( anabond stedman , kanchipuram , india ) and normal saline ( baxter , alathur , india ) were used as irrigants . after cleaning and shaping , the canals were dried and medicated with calcium hydroxide ( endo cal , m dent , bkk , thailand ) mixed with normal saline . after 1 week , patients were recalled and the intracanal medicament was removed and evaluated . once the patient was free of pain , discomfort and canals were dry , the teeth were obturated according to their groups . for group 1 : zinc oxide eugenol ( tubliseal , kerr sybron , romulus , mi ) was used as root canal sealer . the apical extent of the master cone was confirmed with radiograph and the canals were dried . the root canal was coated with the sealer using lentulospirals ( densply canada , woodbridge , canada ) in a slow speed handpiece ( nsk , tochigi , japan ) . obturation was performed with gutta - percha cones and sealer by lateral compaction technique . for group 2 : epoxy resin ( ah plus , dentsply detrey , konstanz , germany ) was used as a sealer . mta ( proroot mta , densply tulsa , johnson city ) was used as root canal sealer in group 3 . to improve the handling properties of mta and to get a sealer like consistency , the powder was mixed with propylene glycol in a mixing pad . mta sealer was coated in canal walls using lentulo spirals in a slow speed handpiece and obturated as in groups 1 and 2 . permanent restorations were done with composite resin ( filtek z 350 , 3 m espe ) and full coverage restoration if necessary after obturation . follow - up evaluations were done after an interval of 1 week and after 6 months . before commencing the evaluation for pain , every patient was explained about the usage of vas using the following criteria : immediately after obturation and placement of coronal seal every patient was asked to mark the pain intensity using a 10 cm vas . all subjects were recalled after 1 week of post - obturation for evaluation of pain and clinically examined . immediate post - obturation

respectively . there was a hs difference in the area measurement comparing the base line and at 6 months , but no difference among the groups at any interval table 4 . invasion of microorganisms into the pulp is responsible for the pathogenesis and necrosis of the vital tissue . elimination of infection from the root canal system followed by its maintenance was found to induce healing . root canal sealers along with obturation material will provide a bacteria proof seal of the root canal system , preventing the leeway space and communications between the intracanal and extracanal environments . the present study was designed to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of three different root canal sealers . no difference in the age , sex , tooth type , tooth distribution , root morphology , pai score and area measurement at baseline suggest that the groups were equally distributed table 5 . baseline values of vas score , pai scores and area measurement zinc oxide eugenol was used as a positive control in this study . this is because it has a history of long - term clinical usage with definitive success rate . it has good handling properties , sealing ability , minimal tissue toxicity , less water solubility , antimicrobial property periapical repair and good radio opacity . ah plus is an epoxy resin based sealer that is widely used because of its compatibility with resin based materials used for obturation and post - endodontic restorations . because of better flow and long setting time , ah plus sealer can penetrates deeper into the surface micro irregularities as well inside the lateral root canals . these properties lead to greater intertwining of the sealer with dentin structure , which , together with the cohesion among the cement molecules provides greater adhesiveness and resistance to dislodgment . mta mixed with propylene glycol was used as a root canal sealer in this study . mta sets hard and its setting time is long enough ( 165 5 min ) to be used as a sealer . calcium sulfate sealers based on mta has demonstrated apatite - like deposits in contact with physiological solutions and a biocompatibility similar to mta . pain was evaluated at 3 time periods - immediately after obturation , 1 week after obturation and 6 months after obturation . on comparison of pain between groups , there was no statistically significant difference in pain experienced by the subjects in any of the time intervals evaluated . clinical difference in pain intensity was observed by patients with epoxy resin sealer experiencing more pain , but was not statistically significant . the results of this study are in accordance with results obtained by alacam in his study . he found no statistical significant difference between the presence and type of post - operative discomfort and the type of sealer utilized . comparison with in the group at different interval has provided a hs difference immediately after the procedure and after 1 week or after 6 months . according to a meta - analysis by nixdorf et al . the incidence of persistent tooth pain after endodontic therapy is 5.3 . the radiological outcome of root canal treatment using three different sealers was evaluated with pai . when compared with in the group , there is a highly statistically significant difference in the pai score at baseline and after 6 months . this dictates that healing of the periapical lesions may take longer time period than 6 months . but , according to a study by jean camps , there was a noticeable change in the periapical lesion after comparing the radiographs taken immediately after treatment , after 3 months and 6 months of endodontic therapy . however , there was no increase in pai score in any of the groups . this implies that all the three sealers used were highly efficient in inducing healing of the periapical tissues . morphometric area measurement was done using vixwin pro digital image analyzing software ( gendex dental systems ) . the periapical lesions were circumscribed by drawing the outline and the software provided the measured area in cm . there was no difference in the baseline data . when compared at different time periods within the same group there was a decrease in the area measured in all the groups after a period of 6 months . there are no previous clinical studies evaluating area measurement using vixwin pro digital image analysis software as criteria for success of endodontic therapy . so , comparison of results with previous studies in the literature is not possible , but ideally it can be judged that , pai records the periapical status of a tooth based on previous reference radiographs , which is more subjective and differs between the examiners . area measurement makes it more objective , better comparison between pre - operative and follow - up evaluation with less inter examiner bias . in this study , mta was mixed with propylene glycol to get a sealer consistency . however in the future studies , an ideal powder liquid ratio with the vehicle should be established . though radiographically detectable difference in periapical lesions can be appreciated in 6 months as used in this study , further longer period evaluation should be carried out in the future . furthermore , the removal of material from the root canal system , if retreatment is indicated should also be evaluated . being a biocompatible material and having the property to induce the deposition of cementum and periapical repair , mta can prove to be a better material than other sealers . the scope of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mta as a root canal sealer considering its radiological and clinical success rate , usage and feasibility . further long - term clinical trials with more criteria should be conducted to conclude the superiority of mta among other root canal sealers . among the three root canal sealers used in this study , no sealer was proven to be superior . mta has performed equally well when compared with the zinc oxide eugenol and ah plus . further long - term clinical trials with more criteria should be conducted to conclude the superiority among these materials .

analysis by nixdorf et al . the incidence of persistent tooth pain after endodontic therapy is 5.3 . the radiological outcome of root canal treatment using three different sealers was evaluated with pai . when compared with in the group , there is a highly statistically significant difference in the pai score at baseline and after 6 months . this dictates that healing of the periapical lesions may take longer time period than 6 months . but , according to a study by jean camps , there was a noticeable change in the periapical lesion after comparing the radiographs taken immediately after treatment , after 3 months and 6 months of endodontic therapy . however , there was no increase in pai score in any of the groups . this implies that all the three sealers used were highly efficient in inducing healing of the periapical tissues . morphometric area measurement was done using vixwin pro digital image analyzing software ( gendex dental systems ) . the periapical lesions were circumscribed by drawing the outline and the software provided the measured area in cm . there was no difference in the baseline data . when compared at different time periods within the same group there was a decrease in the area measured in all the groups after a period of 6 months . there are no previous clinical studies evaluating area measurement using vixwin pro digital image analysis software as criteria for success of endodontic therapy . so , comparison of results with previous studies in the literature is not possible , but ideally it can be judged that , pai records the periapical status of a tooth based on previous reference radiographs , which is more subjective and differs between the examiners . area measurement makes it more objective , better comparison between pre - operative and follow - up evaluation with less inter examiner bias . in this study , mta was mixed with propylene glycol to get a sealer consistency . however in the future studies , an ideal powder liquid ratio with the vehicle should be established . though radiographically detectable difference in periapical lesions can be appreciated in 6 months as used in this study , further longer period evaluation should be carried out in the future . furthermore , the removal of material from the root canal system , if retreatment is indicated should also be evaluated . being a biocompatible material and having the property to induce the deposition of cementum and periapical repair , mta can prove to be a better material than other sealers . the scope of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mta as a root canal sealer considering its radiological and clinical success rate , usage and feasibility . further long - term clinical trials with more criteria should be conducted to conclude the superiority of mta among other root canal sealers . among the three root canal sealers used in this study , no sealer was proven to be superior . mta has performed equally well when compared with the zinc oxide eugenol and ah plus . further long - term clinical trials with more criteria should be conducted to conclude the superiority among these materials .', 10], ['Summarise this text in 5 sentences: in may 2001 , 24 cases of s. typhimurium dt160 salmonellosis were reported in the auckland region compared with an average of four sporadic cases each month with this serotype in the previous 7 months . raw and undercooked egg consumption was commonly reported by the first 10 case -

['Summarise this text in 10 sentences: there are many challenges in reproductive health and it is necessary to train experts to manage them . the aim of this study was to define the tasks of master of science ( msc ) graduates in reproductive health through comprehensive needs assessment to establish the course . the study comprised of three steps . in the first step , through literature review , the draft and basic fields of main tasks were defined . in the second step , by establishing a focus group of 10 experts , the tasks were extracted on the basis of the country s needs . in the third step , a delphi study was carried out among 51 experts who were selected to finalize the list of tasks and their priorities using three criteria of importance , feasibility and availability . 57 tasks were extracted with regard to the four main functions of management and planning , education , consultation , and screening in reproduction age of men and women . according to delphi s results and their priorities , 45 tasks were important and feasible but not available , and they were higher - priority tasks . the tasks extracted are consistent with the framework of reproductive health provided by the world health organization ( who ) and the american guideline of educational planning . however , considering the differences of problems in iran comparing with other countries , the list is not exactly similar to any list prepared for other countries . therefore , it is necessary to consider the results of this research in university curriculums . reproductive health is an important health topic , adolescence , and puberty of men and women . it also influences the health of future generations . by expansion of science , particularly medical sciences , and considering the importance of health , reproductive health is one of the appropriate indices in evaluation of countries development , especially for developing countries . according to the definition provided by who , reproductive health is a state of complete physical , mental , and social wellbeing in reproduction process and function throughout one s life . therefore , all people should have a healthy and satisfactory sexual life , and be able to freely make decision about the time and method of bearing their child . in this regard , all people should have the right to access information , facilities and the highest standards of reproductive and sexual health without any discrimination , obligation or violence . contrary to the definition of reproductive health and the policies of the united nations population fund , most countries , including the usa , canada , and japan , mostly rely on the traditional approach of mother and child health , based on the susceptibility of women in reproduction and fertility roles and paying special attention to the physiologic characteristics of women and their needs . in this regard , ministry of health is responsible for policy - making and general planning for men and women in various aspects . it should be noted that in recent years , application of the gender equality policies and the working plan of the women s world conference in beijing have caused considerable development in health sector and the policies and plans of ministry of health on topics , such as sexual health and aids , screening of cancers , mental health , and prevention of domestic violence . our society also faces some challenges in reproductive health , which should be fundamentally addressed . moreover , by following the health and education regulations , these problems can be prevented or treated , or their rehabilitation be facilitated . some of these problems to consider are infertility , breast cancer , prostate cancer , puberty health , sexual dysfunction , illegal abortions , menopause , health care in these stages of life and new fatal sexually transmitted diseases , such as aids . for instance , breast cancer is among the most common cancers in iranian women . by increasing the general knowledge , timely diagnosis and effective treatment , more than 50 of the cancer patients would experience a long life . therefore , organized educational , health , and therapeutic plans on prevention of breast cancer are required to increase the knowledge level and attitude of women toward breast cancer , and consequently promoting their participation in the screenings . with regard to abortion , the statistics published in 2008 indicated that the global rate of unsafe abortion increased from 19.7 million cases in 2003 to 21.8 million cases in 2008 , which mostly occur in third world countries . this is while the rate was expected to reduce , owing to the improvement in health facilities and conditions . almost one fourth of iranian women experience primary infertility in their married life , with the incidence rate of 3.4 . the couples age , health , treatment modalities , the age of marriage , and fertility potential are important factors in interpretation of the prevalence of primary infertility . by providing training and access to appropriate consultation considering the problems exist in sexual and reproductive health , it is necessary to establish an applied major , which directly deals with the problems of reproduction in the society . in this regard , defining the tasks of graduates in this major in iran as the first step of educational planning is necessary . occupational analysis is usually the first step in educational planning to determine what students should learn . occupational analysis of educational planning is fragmentation of the learning items that the students are expected to learn about how to do the job . occupational analysis helps us to define the skills required for students in learning the prerequisites . therefore , it is necessary to consult the specialist in the field and those who may involve in the process in this respect . the aim of this study was to define the tasks of the msc graduates of reproductive health by experts . web services have been used in some vast needs assessment programs in the world . considering the extension and distribution of the study population , this method was more appropriate for the study . the study comprised of three steps . in the first step , through literature review , the draft and basic fields of main tasks related to the job of msc graduates of reproductive health were defined . then , in the second step and by establishing a focus group of 10 experts of various specialties , the fields and tasks were extracted on the basis of the country s needs . the group consisted of two faculty members of midwifery , four phd students of reproductive health with the career in being faculty members , two obstetricians , one geneticist and one urologist . the group members had a history of working in this field and some of them were involved in curriculum planning . then , small groups of three experts were formed to discuss the list of the major s establishment objectives and its tasks , and finally they achieved consensus on the items . to make sure about the tasks that were extracted by the focus group of experts , the tasks were sent for the representative of each group , and some required modifications were done and returned back to them ; ultimately the approved tasks were determined to be used for opinion poll of other experts . in the third step , delphi study was carried out using the web to finalize the list of tasks and their priorities . at this step , it was necessary to perform priority setting of the tasks and the opinions of experts were obtained . the sampling was goal oriented , and the experts were selected among the iranian obstetrics and gynecology specialists , phd students of reproductive health , the professionals in the field , faculty members of reproductive health , mother and child health , and midwifery . the faculty members were selected from the medical universities with msc courses , such as isfahan , ahwaz , tabriz , tehran , shiraz , and mashhad , and the medical universities which served as the referral centers of some provinces , including yazd , kermanshah , mazandaran , golestan , guilan , and sistan - va baluchestan . the aims of the study and the method of opinion poll were described on a website . the questionnaire included the items on tasks extracted in previous steps , which were presented along with the opinion poll guideline and priority - setting criteria . furthermore , the website guideline with illustrations and examples was prepared and mailed to the participants . to avoid problems related to it priority setting was performed according to a method of altschuld s book , with the three criteria of importance , feasibility was defined as the level the task could be fulfilled by a reproductive health msc graduate and availability was the fact that this service is now provided or not . availability was scored in a 1 - 3 range ; if the service is now completely provided , it scored 3 , if it is not provided at all , it scored 1 , and if it is provided to some extent , it scored 2 . accordingly , the importance factor was scored in a 1 - 5 range , and the feasibility was scored between 1 and 3 , and the participants scored the items according to the lowest and highest scores . the items that obtained scores less than the median value ( 3 for 5-point scale and 2 for 3-point scale ) were considered to be less important or unavailable or infeasible all priority conditions of the tasks in the opinion poll webpage , the participants could write down their comments on each task in specific boxes . the comments were reachable for the researcher as they were sent . after performing the opinion poll , the scores of each priority - setting criterion and the mean score for each task were calculated . in the first step , the draft of tasks in 19 main areas was obtained using literature review . then , in the second step , the tasks were completed and modified by evaluation of the focus group . then they were categorized on the basis of the four main stages of reproduction and its four subsidiary classifications . 57 tasks were extracted with regard to the four main functions of management and planning , education , consultation , and screening in reproduction age of men and women ; that is , before and during puberty , before marriage , reproduction ( pre- pregnancy , pregnancy , post - pregnancy and infertility ) , and menopause and older age . in the third step , to achieve the best possible results from the opinion poll , we tried to make use of the comments of experts and health managers from ministry of health and different universities , who were scientifically competent and had enough experience in this field . of those who attended the study , 33 were specialists in the field of mother and child health , and 29 in the field of reproductive health . the 57 tasks and their mean scores assigned to priority- setting criteria are provided in table 2 . results of priority setting of the tasks with regard to table 2 , tasks no . 18 , 22 , 26 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 41 , 42 , 43 , and 44 obtained the mean importance score above the median score 3 , the feasibility score above the median score 2 , and the availability scores above the median score 2 . this shows that the item is important , feasible , and available , and further action is not required for it ; thus , the item can be eliminated , or has a low priority . as can be observed , the tasks deal with topics , such as high - risk pregnancy , breast feeding , and family planning . the remaining tasks ( 45 tasks ) are the needs ; we should focus on meeting them . with regard to the results obtained and considering the viewpoints of the needs assessment team , 22 , 18 , 26 , 38 , 43 , and 44 to the major , and as the needs assessment team agreed , these items were not eliminated , but received lower priority in educational planning . we took advantage from expert s opinions in evaluating the tasks of msc graduates of reproductive health . in this respect , the tasks extracted were consistent with the framework of reproductive health provided by the who and the american guideline of educational planning . however , according to the differences in problems of our country with those of the others , the list of tasks was not exactly similar to any list prepared for other countries . altschuld method was used to perform the priority- setting in needs assessment , because the major did not exist before . thus , it was not possible to determine the gap between the present and desirable states . moreover , there are currently other specialties that provide services in the same field in the health system . so , in needs assessment , the importance of tasks defined for meeting the needs of people s reproductive health were considered , as well as the unavailability and feasibility of the services . the results showed that in experts opinion , all the tasks extracted were important for the graduates , and most of the tasks , 46 out of 57 , were not currently provided . these tasks were related to management and planning , education and consultation about the puberty and pre- puberty health and the issues related to them , sexual health , elderly health , menopause , empowerment of women , and participation of men . the experts believed that the items were important ( all scored above 4 ) , and were not available for the people . according to the experts , of the tasks proposed 10 items these items were feasible ; however , since they were available and were provided by graduates of other specialties , the items were not given high priorities . the needs that do not require further action according to the priority - setting scale . thus , it is not necessary to train new specialists to provide these services . with regard to the remaining tasks , the experts believed that the services were not provided at all or provided to degrees less than somehow . moreover , except for management and planning for changing of gender beliefs and superstitions of families and the society , on which the experts did not agree , all other items were feasible . therefore , these services should necessarily be provided by some individuals or systems . in this regard , general evaluation of the tasks extracted indicated that the process of defining tasks of reproductive health was performed multi dimensionally and accurately . the tasks defined cover all stages of reproductive age and all feasible duties in the field of health . reproductive health for the two ends of reproduction age , that is , adolescence and higher ages , are important issues in iranian reproductive health . this is because although almost 34 of the current iranian population is young , the elderly population in urban areas has been grown fourfold in the past 30 years . furthermore , in near future , a high percentage of the population would be old , and consequently the reproductive health needs associated with these ages would become important . management and planning , consultation , education and other items related to reproductive health in older age groups of men and menopause of women were of the main tasks defined for the major . these tasks can be of the current and future tasks , which should receive appropriate attention . this is due to the increasing growth in elderly population in iran , as it is estimated that in 2031 , elderly population boom will occur in iran , and 25-30 of the population will then be above 50 years of age . the tasks related to sexual health were among the tasks that were considered in all stages of life . in spite of obtaining high scores , the tasks of education and consultation about the gender and sexual roles were defined in this regard . many studies have been carried out on adolescents , and showed that the adolescents were unfamiliar with sexual issues , and there is a need for education and consultation of adolescents in this respect.1821 some researchers have evaluated gender roles of men and women and found the problems of this field . they recommend that by pre and post marriage consultation , the couples should become familiar with mental schema and cultural clich , and the influence of these factors on mental assessment of sexual arousal and satisfaction with sexual relationship . moreover , the importance of these factors should be taught to decrease the problems of married life . considering the tasks defined for the major , the graduates can more specifically meet the needs of the society in this respect . a branch of this item is violence against women , which is a topic proposed by the who as an item for assessment and follow up in reproductive health . some researchers believe that violence against women and children within the families has decreased ; however , the problems require education with the aim of changing the behavior . department of reproductive health in the who with the aid of the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) and human reproduction program ( hrp ) has defined the main topics of reproductive health . these topics would be helpful in research on reproductive health and making the policy makers , scientists , health care providers , physicians , consumers , and representatives of the society aware of the research priorities in development of reproductive and gender health . the topics were namely , older age and reproductive and gender health , family planning , women s circumcision , and other harmful practices , infertility , mothers health and abortion , urinary tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , aids , relationship between reproductive health and aids , unsafe abortions , and violence against women . considering the health state of our society and frequency of the problems , however , some less frequent topics in our country , such as women s circumcision , were not placed among the main topics , and considering the young population of iran , some topics such as those related to adolescents were mentioned as the main topics in reproductive health needs . some limitations of the study were obligation in selection of the participants from the specialists of the field , because they were mostly busy and did not have enough time to answer the questions . to overcome this problem , the study was better to be performed in a larger time interval and during academic off day . considering the results obtained , the authorities should develop the reproductive health major in subgroups , such as sexual health , research in reproductive health , and reproduction rights , and also modify the curriculum of courses related to the field for students of medical sciences . furthermore , researchers should carry out more studies on the neglected tasks of physicians in reproductive health .

availability . 57 tasks were extracted with regard to the four main functions of management and planning , education , consultation , and screening in reproduction age of men and women . according to delphi s results and their priorities , 45 tasks were important and feasible but not available , and they were higher - priority tasks . the tasks extracted are consistent with the framework of reproductive health provided by the world health organization ( who ) and the american guideline of educational planning . however , considering the differences of problems in iran comparing with other countries , the list is not exactly similar to any list prepared for other countries . therefore , it is necessary to consider the results of this research in university curriculums . reproductive health is an important health topic , adolescence , and puberty of men and women . it also influences the health of future generations . by expansion of science , particularly medical sciences , and considering the importance of health , reproductive health is one of the appropriate indices in evaluation of countries development , especially for developing countries . according to the definition provided by who , reproductive health is a state of complete physical , mental , and social wellbeing in reproduction process and function throughout one s life . therefore , all people should have a healthy and satisfactory sexual life , and be able to freely make decision about the time and method of bearing their child . in this regard , all people should have the right to access information , facilities and the highest standards of reproductive and sexual health without any discrimination , obligation or violence . contrary to the definition of reproductive health and the policies of the united nations population fund , most countries , including the usa , canada , and japan , mostly rely on the traditional approach of mother and child health , based on the susceptibility of women in reproduction and fertility roles and paying special attention to the physiologic characteristics of women and their needs . in this regard , ministry of health is responsible for policy - making and general planning for men and women in various aspects . it should be noted that in recent years , application of the gender equality policies and the working plan of the women s world conference in beijing have caused considerable development in health sector and the policies and plans of ministry of health on topics , such as sexual health and aids , screening of cancers , mental health , and prevention of domestic violence . our society also faces some challenges in reproductive health , which should be fundamentally addressed . moreover , by following the health and education regulations , these problems can be prevented or treated , or their rehabilitation be facilitated . some of these problems to consider are infertility , breast cancer , prostate cancer , puberty health , sexual dysfunction , illegal abortions , menopause , health care in these stages of life and new fatal sexually transmitted diseases , such as aids . for instance , breast cancer is among the most common cancers in iranian women . by increasing the general knowledge , timely diagnosis and effective treatment , more than 50 of the cancer patients would experience a long life . therefore , organized educational , health , and therapeutic plans on prevention of breast cancer are required to increase the knowledge level and attitude of women toward breast cancer , and consequently promoting their participation in the screenings . with regard to abortion , the statistics published in 2008 indicated that the global rate of unsafe abortion increased from 19.7 million cases in 2003 to 21.8 million cases in 2008 , which mostly occur in third world countries . this is while the rate was expected to reduce , owing to the improvement in health facilities and conditions . almost one fourth of iranian women experience primary infertility in their married life , with the incidence rate of 3.4 . the couples age , health , treatment modalities , the age of marriage , and fertility potential are important factors in interpretation of the prevalence of primary infertility . by providing training and access to appropriate consultation considering the problems exist in sexual and reproductive health , it is necessary to establish an applied major , which directly deals with the problems of reproduction in the society . in this regard , defining the tasks of graduates in this major in iran as the first step of educational planning is necessary . occupational analysis is usually the first step in educational planning to determine what students should learn . occupational analysis of educational planning is fragmentation of the learning items that the students are expected to learn about how to do the job . occupational analysis helps us to define the skills required for students in learning the prerequisites . therefore , it is necessary to consult the specialist in the field and those who may involve in the process in this respect . the aim of this study was to define the tasks of the msc graduates of reproductive health by experts . web services have been used in some vast needs assessment programs in the world . considering the extension and distribution of the study population , this method was more appropriate for the study . the study comprised of three steps . in the first step , through literature review , the draft and basic fields of main tasks related to the job of msc graduates of reproductive health were defined . then , in the second step and by establishing a focus group of 10 experts of various specialties , the fields and tasks were extracted on the basis of the country s needs . the group consisted of two faculty members of midwifery , four phd students of reproductive health with the career in being faculty members , two obstetricians , one geneticist and one urologist . the group members had a history of working in this field and some of them were involved in curriculum planning . then , small groups of three experts were formed to discuss the list of the major s establishment objectives and its tasks , and finally they achieved consensus on the items . to make sure about the tasks that were extracted by the focus group of experts , the tasks were sent for the representative of each group , and some required modifications were done and returned back to them ; ultimately the approved tasks were determined to be used for opinion poll of other experts . in the third step , delphi study was carried out using the web to finalize the list of tasks and their priorities . at this step , it was necessary to perform priority setting of the tasks and the opinions of experts were obtained . the sampling was goal oriented , and the experts were selected among the iranian obstetrics and gynecology specialists , phd students of reproductive health , the professionals in the field , faculty members of reproductive health , mother and child health , and midwifery . the faculty members were selected from the medical universities with msc courses , such as isfahan , ahwaz , tabriz , tehran , shiraz , and mashhad , and the medical universities which served as the referral centers of some provinces , including yazd , kermanshah , mazandaran , golestan , guilan , and sistan - va baluchestan . the aims of the study and the method of opinion poll were described on a website . the questionnaire included the items on tasks extracted in previous steps , which were presented along with the opinion poll guideline and priority - setting criteria . furthermore , the website guideline with illustrations and examples was prepared and mailed to the participants . to avoid problems related to it priority setting was performed according to a method of altschuld s book , with the three criteria of importance , feasibility was defined as the level the task could be fulfilled by a reproductive health msc graduate and availability was the fact that this service is now provided or not . availability was scored in a 1 - 3 range ; if the service is now completely provided , it scored 3 , if it is not provided at all , it scored 1 , and if it is provided to some extent , it scored 2 . accordingly , the importance factor was scored in a 1 - 5 range , and the feasibility was scored between 1 and 3 , and the participants scored the items according to the lowest and highest scores . the items that obtained scores less than the median value ( 3 for 5-point scale and 2 for 3-point scale ) were considered to be less important or unavailable or infeasible all priority conditions of the tasks in the opinion poll webpage , the participants could write down their comments on each task in specific boxes . the comments were reachable for the researcher as they were sent . after performing the opinion poll , the scores of each priority - setting criterion and the mean score for each task were calculated . in the first step , the draft of tasks in 19 main areas was obtained using literature review . then , in the second step , the tasks were completed and modified by evaluation of the focus group . then they were categorized on the basis of the four main stages of reproduction and its four subsidiary classifications . 57 tasks were extracted with regard to the four main functions of management and planning , education , consultation , and screening in reproduction age of men and women ; that is , before and during puberty , before marriage , reproduction ( pre- pregnancy , pregnancy , post - pregnancy and infertility ) , and menopause and older age . in the third step , to achieve the best possible results from the opinion poll , we tried to make use of the comments of experts and health managers from ministry of health and different universities , who were scientifically competent and had enough experience in this field . of those who attended the study , 33 were specialists in the field of mother and child health , and 29 in the field of reproductive health . the 57 tasks and their mean scores assigned to priority- setting criteria are provided in table 2 . results of priority setting of the tasks with regard to table 2 , tasks no . 18 , 22 , 26 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 41 , 42 , 43 , and 44 obtained the mean importance score above the median score 3 , the feasibility score above the median score 2 , and the availability scores above the median score 2 . this shows that the item is important , feasible , and available , and further action is not required for it ; thus , the item can be eliminated , or has a low priority . as can be observed , the tasks deal with topics , such as high - risk pregnancy , breast feeding , and family planning . the remaining tasks ( 45 tasks ) are the needs ; we should focus on meeting them . with regard to the results obtained and considering the viewpoints of the needs assessment team , 22 , 18 , 26 , 38 , 43 , and 44 to the major , and as the needs assessment team agreed , these items were not eliminated , but received lower priority in educational planning . we took advantage from expert s opinions in evaluating the tasks of msc graduates of reproductive health . in this respect , the tasks extracted were consistent with the framework of reproductive health provided by the who and the american guideline of educational planning . however , according to the differences in problems of our country with those of the others , the list of tasks was not exactly similar to any list prepared for other countries . altschuld method was used to perform the priority- setting in needs assessment , because the major did not exist before . thus , it was not possible to determine the gap between the present and desirable states . moreover , there are currently other specialties that provide services in the same field in the health system . so , in needs assessment , the importance of tasks defined for meeting the needs of people s reproductive health were considered , as well as the unavailability and feasibility of the services . the results showed that in experts opinion , all the tasks extracted were important for the graduates , and most of the tasks , 46 out of 57 , were not currently provided . these tasks were related to management and planning , education and consultation about the puberty and pre- puberty health and the issues related to them , sexual health , elderly health , menopause , empowerment of women , and participation of men . the experts believed that the items were important ( all scored above 4 ) , and were not available for the people . according to the experts , of the tasks proposed 10 items these items were feasible ; however , since they were available and were provided by graduates of other specialties , the items were not given high priorities . the needs that do not require further action according to the priority - setting scale . thus , it is not necessary to train new specialists to provide these services . with regard to the remaining tasks , the experts believed that the services were not provided at all or provided to degrees less than somehow . moreover , except for management and planning for changing of gender beliefs and superstitions of families and the society , on which the experts did not agree , all other items were feasible . therefore , these services should necessarily be provided by some individuals or systems . in this regard , general evaluation of the tasks extracted indicated that the process of defining tasks of reproductive health was performed multi dimensionally and accurately . the tasks defined cover all stages of reproductive age and all feasible duties in the field of health . reproductive health for the two ends of reproduction age , that is , adolescence and higher ages , are important issues in iranian reproductive health . this is because although almost 34 of the current iranian population is young , the elderly population in urban areas has been grown fourfold in the past 30 years . furthermore , in near future , a high percentage of the population would be old , and consequently the reproductive health needs associated with these ages would become important . management and planning , consultation , education and other items related to reproductive health in older age groups of men and menopause of women were of the main tasks defined for the major . these tasks can be of the current and future tasks , which should receive appropriate attention . this is due to the increasing growth in elderly population in iran , as it is estimated that in 2031 , elderly population boom will occur in iran , and 25-30 of the population will then be above 50 years of age . the tasks related to sexual health were among the tasks that were considered in all stages of life . in spite of obtaining high scores , the tasks of education and consultation about the gender and sexual roles were defined in this regard . many studies have been carried out on adolescents , and showed that the adolescents were unfamiliar with sexual issues , and there is a need for education and consultation of adolescents in this respect.1821 some researchers have evaluated gender roles of men and women and found the problems of this field . they recommend that by pre and post marriage consultation , the couples should become familiar with mental schema and cultural clich , and the influence of these factors on mental assessment of sexual arousal and satisfaction with sexual relationship . moreover , the importance of these factors should be taught to decrease the problems of married life . considering the tasks defined for the major , the graduates can more specifically meet the needs of the society in this respect . a branch of this item is violence against women , which is a topic proposed by the who as an item for assessment and follow up in reproductive health . some researchers believe that violence against women and children within the families has decreased ; however , the problems require education with the aim of changing the behavior . department of reproductive health in the who with the aid of the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) and human reproduction program ( hrp ) has defined the main topics of reproductive health . these topics would be helpful in research on reproductive health and making the policy makers , scientists , health care providers , physicians , consumers , and representatives of the society aware of the research priorities in development of reproductive and gender health . the topics were namely , older age and reproductive and gender health , family planning , women s circumcision , and other harmful practices , infertility , mothers health and abortion , urinary tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , aids , relationship between reproductive health and aids , unsafe abortions , and violence against women . considering the health state of our society and frequency of the problems , however , some less frequent topics in our country , such as women s circumcision , were not placed among the main topics , and considering the young population of iran , some topics such as those related to adolescents were mentioned as the main topics in reproductive health needs . some limitations of the study were obligation in selection of the participants from the specialists of the field , because they were mostly busy and did not have enough time to answer the questions . to overcome this problem , the study was better to be performed in a larger time interval and during academic off day . considering the results obtained , the authorities should develop the reproductive health major in subgroups , such as sexual health , research in reproductive health , and reproduction rights , and also modify the curriculum of courses related to the field for students of medical sciences . furthermore , researchers should carry out more studies on the neglected tasks of physicians in reproductive health .', 12], ['Summarise this text in 3 bullet-points: forward head posture ( fhp ) is a commonly noted abnormal neck posture in students who carry heavy loads or maintain a sitting posture for long periods1,2,3 . fhp is defined as the hyperextension of the upper cervical and a forward translation of the cervical vertebrae4 . fhp increases the compressive loading on tissues in the cervical spine , particularly the facet joints , and stress on the ligaments4 , 5 . also , fhp can induce neck pain and increase electromyographic activity in the neck muscles4 , 6 . for these reasons , fhp is known to lead not only to neck pain but also to changes in cervical movement patterns7 , 8 . alterations in cervical spine movement can provide clinicians with information that assists assessment and treatment and in monitoring the efficacy of rehabilitation programs in fhp populations1 , 9 , 10 . in particular , the neck rotation test is often performed for evaluation of cervical spine dysfunction7 . for the neck rotation test , the subject is asked to maximally rotate the head by turning to one side , left or right , in a sitting position11 . comerford and mottram11 stated that generating lateral flexion motion during neck rotation can cause dysfunction and pain in the cervical spine . thus , to prevent unwanted cervical lateral flexion during cervical rotation , many clinicians and researchers emphasize cervical axial rotation so as not to complicate rotation with other neck motions , such as flexion , extension , and lateral flexion12 , 13 . cervical axial rotation along the longitudinal axis is considered clinically important for painless neck motion14 . for precise cervical axial rotation , it is necessary to properly control the activation of the neck muscles11 , 15 , 16 . however , precise neck movements in fhp populations are typically difficult because they have problems with alterations in the length and activation of the neck muscles8 , 17 . the primary problems in fhp are shortening and hyperactivation of the sternocleidomastoid ( scm ) muscle7 , 8 , 18 . the scm muscle acts in neck rotation and lateral flexion as well as in neck flexion . however , many previous studies of fhp and scm muscles have focused largely on movements in the sagittal plane , such as flexion and extension1 , 5 , 10 . also , movements in the frontal plane , which involve hyperactivation of the scm muscles , have been overlooked in patients with fhp . although patients with fhp may be exposed to neck pain caused by hyperactivation of the scm muscles , to our knowledge , kinematic analysis of lateral flexion movement patterns of subjects with fhp during neck rotation has not been reported . repeated cervical lateral flexion and translation motions due to fhp posture that occur during cervical rotation in a sitting position or in activities of daily life may cause tissue microtrauma , overuse syndrome , mechanical dysfunction , and development of pain in the cervical spine12 , 19 . for this reason , it is important to understand the kinematics of lateral flexion movement patterns and scm muscle activation during neck rotation in subjects with fhp . furthermore , although the neck rotation test is commonly used to evaluate cervical motion in the sagittal plane , there is potential for using this test for evaluating motion in the frontal plane as part of a clinical evaluation for neck problems in subjects with fhp . thus , the aims of this study were to compare 1 ) the rotation - lateral flexion ratio , 2 ) the lateral flexion movement onset time , 3 ) the rotation and lateral flexion angles , and 4 ) the muscle activation of scm between individuals with fhp and controls during neck rotation . we hypothesized that 1 ) the rotation - lateral flexion ratios would be higher , 2 ) the lateral flexion movement onset time would be earlier , and 3 ) the rotation and lateral flexion angle values would be higher during neck rotation in the fhp group ; we also hypothesized that 4 ) the scm muscles would be more highly activated during maintenance of end - range neck rotation in both directions in the fhp group than in control subjects . in total , 28 subjects were recruited from university students in korea ( 14 control students , 14 fhp students ) . subjects were recruited into the fhp group if they had a forward translated neck alignment ; the fhp group was selected by evaluating the horizontal distance from a vertical line through the lobe of the ear and the acromion process in the sagittal plane ( fhp 5 cm)20 . additionally , to classify the groups , the cranio - vertebral angle ( cva ) was measured in all subjects . the intra - class correlation coefficient ( icc ) of the cva measurement method has been reported to be high ( icc 0.88)21 . exclusion criteria included past or present spinal canal stenosis , rheumatoid arthritis , and vestibulobasilar insufficiency . before the experiment , we explained all procedures and the purpose of the study to the subjects in detail . all subjects signed an informed consent form , which was approved by the inje university college of health science human studies committee . in all sessions , the kinematics were recorded using a three - dimensional ultrasound - based motion analysis system and muscle activity was measured using electromyography . data collection using the two systems occurred simultaneously so that data were synchronized for a more complete and valid analysis . a three - dimensional ultrasound - based motion analysis system ( zebris cms20 , zebris meditechnic gmbh , isny , germany ) was used to collect kinematic data . two components of ultrasound triple markers , one installed on the apex of the head and another attached to the right lateral shoulder , were fixed to accept real time neck motion data via a transducer sensor , which consisted of three microphones . the transducer sensor was placed perpendicular and to the right of the subject at a distance of 1 m. the preferred neck position was set at zero based on the starting position before each test . the kinematic data - sampling rate was 20 hz . for measurement of neck movements , the icc for intra - session test - retest reliability had been previously established as 0.730.90 , as well as inter - session reliability of 0.430.6822 . rotation and the lateral flexion angle of the neck were recorded in real time during neck rotation to identify the ratio of rotation to lateral flexion movements to the ipsilateral or contralateral side . the collected kinematic raw data were converted to ascii files for analysis . the movement onset time and the motion of the neck the point exceeding a threshold angle of 1 was defined as the onset time of neck movement23 . the mean value of three trials was analyzed to determine onset time and rotation - lateral flexion movement patterns during neck rotation . finally , the rotation - lateral flexion ratio was calculated as the lateral flexion angle divided by the rotation angle , multiplied by 100 . electromyographic ( emg ) signals from the scm muscles were recorded and analyzed using a surface electromyography system ( mp150 , biopac systems , inc . santa barbara , ca , usa ) . skin preparation at the attachment sites consisted of shaving and cleaning the skin with an alcohol swab . emg data were recorded from the scm muscle ( 13 of the distance from the sternal notch to the mastoid process , parallel and over the muscle belly)24 . ( 20450 hz ) and a band - stop filter ( 60 hz ) were used . raw data were transformed into the root mean square with a window of 50 ms . for normalization , muscle contraction reference data were collected while the subject performed two maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( mvic ) trials over a 5-s period in a manual scm muscle testing position4 . the average value of the middle 3 s of the 5-s trial was used , and the average of two trials was calculated for normalization . during the maintenance phase , the average emg data from the middle 3 s of the 5-s measurement were used to compare the fhp and control groups . neck and trunk postures were not adjusted , and the usual posture of each subject was maintained throughout the experiment . subjects were strapped to the chair to minimize compensation by trunk motion during the test . before the test , each subject was instructed to perform neck rotation in the preferred rotation range in two directions ( left and right ) randomly to identify end range of motion . neck rotation end range was defined as maximum range through which each subject could actively rotate his her cervical spine in each direction . once end range of motion was established , the neck rotation test was repeated three times in each direction . the initial direction of neck rotation test was randomized , and a 1-min rest was allowed between trials . to minimize differences in vestibular function during the neck rotation , each subject conducted the neck rotation for 6 s ( rotation phase ) at a speed of 15s25 and maintained the end - range position for 5 s ( maintenance phase ) , all timed using a metronome . differences in the rotation - lateral flexion ratio , rotation angle , lateral flexion angle , scm activation , and subject demographic in each direction between subjects with and without fhp was evaluated using independent t - tests . the spss statistical package ( ver . 18.0 , spss , chicago , il , usa ) was used for all statistical analyses and a p - value 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance . subjects in the two groups were of similar age , height , and weight ( p 0.05 ) . the forward head distance was significantly increased in the fhp group compared with the control group ( p 0.05 ) . the results of the kinematic analyses are presented in table 1table 1. rotation-lateral flexion movement patterns , mean ( sd ) , during neck rotation to the left and right between two groupsdirectioncontrol group(n 14)fhp groupn 14)rotation - lateral flexion ratio ( ) left10.01 ( 5.11)13.46 ( 10.92)right6.43 ( 3.58)6.81 ( 4.80)rotation angle ( )left52.15 ( 7.12)62.72 ( 6.94)right51.58 ( 7.90)59.45 ( 7.35)lateral flexion angle ( )left3.39 ( 1.95)6.22 ( 3.01)right3.46 ( 2.55)7.97 ( 6.21)lateral flexion onset time ( s)left1.68 ( 0.79)1.04 ( 0.45)right1.54 ( 0.75)0.88 ( 0.39)fhp : forward head posture ;

sd : standard deviation . many researchers emphasize correct neck motion to minimize dysfunction in the adjacent structures of the cervical spine17 , 26 . although fhp is a common physical finding in persons with malalignment of the neck , to our knowledge , there have not been any publications investigating variations in neck kinematics in fhp during neck rotation3 , 27 , 28 . here , we investigated rotation - lateral flexion movement patterns and scm activation during neck rotation in fhp and control subjects . our data suggest differences in the rotation - lateral flexion movement patterns and activation of scm muscles between the fhp and control groups during neck rotation . the data showed relatively less axial neck rotation in the fhp group than in the control group . this may be because long - duration fhp maintenance induces alterations in cervical motor control and muscle imbalance of the neck muscles , such as the scm . faulty alignment , neck muscle imbalances , and alteration of motor control of the cervical spine have been reported to contribute to neck movements5 , 6 , 8 , 18 . also , no other axial neck rotation could induce repetitive translation motion in the transverse plane in the cervical spine as often as neck rotation , and translation motion can induce cervical instability12 and spinal disorders31 . the scm muscles of subjects with fhp showed greater imbalance between the left and right muscles compared with the control group . this may be because the scm muscles in the fhp group are hyperactive during neck motion due to changes in the condition of the neck muscles caused by maintaining a faulty posture such as fhp . the muscle imbalance induced by fhp can result in decreased muscular efficiency and increased activation of the additional muscles needed to maintain neck and head posture29 . as a result , subjects with fhp used contralateral scm muscles to a greater extent during neck rotation than did the control subjects . these kinematics and emg data show that subjects with fhp have different pattern of neck movement and scm activation than those without fhp . these aspects may indicate that global muscles , such as the scm , are being used instead of local muscles during neck rotation . global muscles are known to function as musculature for multi - segmental joints , and they generate large movements rather than precise movements7 , 8 , 17 . thus , excessive activation of scm - controlled lateral flexion during neck rotation occurred significantly more in people with fhp than in control subjects . although statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical significance , clinicians may recognize the clinical implications of these findings for preventing neck problems in fhp patients . neck rotation tests can be used to assess movement of the cervical spine7 , 11 . however , many clinicians overlook motion in the frontal plane and examine only movement in the sagittal plane in fhp1 , 32 , 33 . thus , it should be recommended that clinicians examine lateral flexion in the frontal plane when assessing and treating patients with fhp . in this study , the angle of rotation in the fhp group was significantly higher than that in the control group . however , a previous study demonstrated that subjects with fhp had a decreased range of motion of neck rotation compared with the control group30 ; this differs from our findings . it is possible that the subjects with fhp in this study may have compensated for the decreased range of neck motion by lateral flexion the neck . this may have resulted in our overlooking differences in the direction of lateral flexion movements during preferred neck rotation . in future research , the direction of lateral flexion movement generated during neck rotation should be identified and considered within the interpretation of the results . second , our results can not be generalized to other age groups because all subjects were university students . finally , we did not measure emg activity in the intrinsic neck rotator muscles . our results demonstrate that neck rotation in subjects with fhp is characterized by lateral flexion in addition to axial rotation compared with subjects without fhp . the clinical importance of this study lies in its confirmation of often - overlooked neck movement in the frontal plane and the provision of baseline data for future clinical interventions concerning lateral flexion in subjects with fhp . additionally , significant differences in activation patterns of the scm muscles were noted in individuals with fhp , specifically with increased recruitment on the contralateral side during movement . assessment of neck rotation movement in patients with fhp should take into consideration lateral flexion in the frontal plane and contralateral scm activation .

the fhp group was selected by evaluating the horizontal distance from a vertical line through the lobe of the ear and the acromion process in the sagittal plane ( fhp 5 cm)20 . additionally , to classify the groups , the cranio - vertebral angle ( cva ) was measured in all subjects . the intra - class correlation coefficient ( icc ) of the cva measurement method has been reported to be high ( icc 0.88)21 . exclusion criteria included past or present spinal canal stenosis , rheumatoid arthritis , and vestibulobasilar insufficiency . before the experiment , we explained all procedures and the purpose of the study to the subjects in detail . all subjects signed an informed consent form , which was approved by the inje university college of health science human studies committee . in all sessions , the kinematics were recorded using a three - dimensional ultrasound - based motion analysis system and muscle activity was measured using electromyography . data collection using the two systems occurred simultaneously so that data were synchronized for a more complete and valid analysis . a three - dimensional ultrasound - based motion analysis system ( zebris cms20 , zebris meditechnic gmbh , isny , germany ) was used to collect kinematic data . two components of ultrasound triple markers , one installed on the apex of the head and another attached to the right lateral shoulder , were fixed to accept real time neck motion data via a transducer sensor , which consisted of three microphones . the transducer sensor was placed perpendicular and to the right of the subject at a distance of 1 m. the preferred neck position was set at zero based on the starting position before each test . the kinematic data - sampling rate was 20 hz . for measurement of neck movements , the icc for intra - session test - retest reliability had been previously established as 0.730.90 , as well as inter - session reliability of 0.430.6822 . rotation and the lateral flexion angle of the neck were recorded in real time during neck rotation to identify the ratio of rotation to lateral flexion movements to the ipsilateral or contralateral side . the collected kinematic raw data were converted to ascii files for analysis . the movement onset time and the motion of the neck the point exceeding a threshold angle of 1 was defined as the onset time of neck movement23 . the mean value of three trials was analyzed to determine onset time and rotation - lateral flexion movement patterns during neck rotation . finally , the rotation - lateral flexion ratio was calculated as the lateral flexion angle divided by the rotation angle , multiplied by 100 . electromyographic ( emg ) signals from the scm muscles were recorded and analyzed using a surface electromyography system ( mp150 , biopac systems , inc . santa barbara , ca , usa ) . skin preparation at the attachment sites consisted of shaving and cleaning the skin with an alcohol swab . emg data were recorded from the scm muscle ( 13 of the distance from the sternal notch to the mastoid process , parallel and over the muscle belly)24 . ( 20450 hz ) and a band - stop filter ( 60 hz ) were used . raw data were transformed into the root mean square with a window of 50 ms . for normalization , muscle contraction reference data were collected while the subject performed two maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( mvic ) trials over a 5-s period in a manual scm muscle testing position4 . the average value of the middle 3 s of the 5-s trial was used , and the average of two trials was calculated for normalization . during the maintenance phase , the average emg data from the middle 3 s of the 5-s measurement were used to compare the fhp and control groups . neck and trunk postures were not adjusted , and the usual posture of each subject was maintained throughout the experiment . subjects were strapped to the chair to minimize compensation by trunk motion during the test . before the test , each subject was instructed to perform neck rotation in the preferred rotation range in two directions ( left and right ) randomly to identify end range of motion . neck rotation end range was defined as maximum range through which each subject could actively rotate his her cervical spine in each direction . once end range of motion was established , the neck rotation test was repeated three times in each direction . the initial direction of neck rotation test was randomized , and a 1-min rest was allowed between trials . to minimize differences in vestibular function during the neck rotation , each subject conducted the neck rotation for 6 s ( rotation phase ) at a speed of 15s25 and maintained the end - range position for 5 s ( maintenance phase ) , all timed using a metronome . differences in the rotation - lateral flexion ratio , rotation angle , lateral flexion angle , scm activation , and subject demographic in each direction between subjects with and without fhp was evaluated using independent t - tests . the spss statistical package ( ver . 18.0 , spss , chicago , il , usa ) was used for all statistical analyses and a p - value 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance . subjects in the two groups were of similar age , height , and weight ( p 0.05 ) . the forward head distance was significantly increased in the fhp group compared with the control group ( p 0.05 ) . the results of the kinematic analyses are presented in table 1table 1. rotation-lateral flexion movement patterns , mean ( sd ) , during neck rotation to the left and right between two groupsdirectioncontrol group(n 14)fhp groupn 14)rotation -

lateral flexion movement patterns and scm activation during neck rotation in fhp and control subjects . our data suggest differences in the rotation - lateral flexion movement patterns and activation of scm muscles between the fhp and control groups during neck rotation . the data showed relatively less axial neck rotation in the fhp group than in the control group . this may be because long - duration fhp maintenance induces alterations in cervical motor control and muscle imbalance of the neck muscles , such as the scm . faulty alignment , neck muscle imbalances , and alteration of motor control of the cervical spine have been reported to contribute to neck movements5 , 6 , 8 , 18 . also , no other axial neck rotation could induce repetitive translation motion in the transverse plane in the cervical spine as often as neck rotation , and translation motion can induce cervical instability12 and spinal disorders31 . the scm muscles of subjects with fhp showed greater imbalance between the left and right muscles compared with the control group . this may be because the scm muscles in the fhp group are hyperactive during neck motion due to changes in the condition of the neck muscles caused by maintaining a faulty posture such as fhp . the muscle imbalance induced by fhp can result in decreased muscular efficiency and increased activation of the additional muscles needed to maintain neck and head posture29 . as a result , subjects with fhp used contralateral scm muscles to a greater extent during neck rotation than did the control subjects . these kinematics and emg data show that subjects with fhp have different pattern of neck movement and scm activation than those without fhp . these aspects may indicate that global muscles , such as the scm , are being used instead of local muscles during neck rotation . global muscles are known to function as musculature for multi - segmental joints , and they generate large movements rather than precise movements7 , 8 , 17 . thus , excessive activation of scm - controlled lateral flexion during neck rotation occurred significantly more in people with fhp than in control subjects . although statistical significance does not necessarily imply clinical significance , clinicians may recognize the clinical implications of these findings for preventing neck problems in fhp patients . neck rotation tests can be used to assess movement of the cervical spine7 , 11 . however , many clinicians overlook motion in the frontal plane and examine only movement in the sagittal plane in fhp1 , 32 , 33 . thus , it should be recommended that clinicians examine lateral flexion in the frontal plane when assessing and treating patients with fhp . in this study , the angle of rotation in the fhp group was significantly higher than that in the control group . however , a previous study demonstrated that subjects with fhp had a decreased range of motion of neck rotation compared with the control group30 ; this differs from our findings . it is possible that the subjects with fhp in this study may have compensated for the decreased range of neck motion by lateral flexion the neck . this may have resulted in our overlooking differences in the direction of lateral flexion movements during preferred neck rotation . in future research , the direction of lateral flexion movement generated during neck rotation should be identified and considered within the interpretation of the results . second , our results can not be generalized to other age groups because all subjects were university students . finally , we did not measure emg activity in the intrinsic neck rotator muscles . our results demonstrate that neck rotation in subjects with fhp is characterized by lateral flexion in addition to axial rotation compared with subjects without fhp . the clinical importance of this study lies in its confirmation of often - overlooked neck movement in the frontal plane and the provision of baseline data for future clinical interventions concerning lateral flexion in subjects with fhp . additionally , significant differences in activation patterns of the scm muscles were noted in individuals with fhp , specifically with increased recruitment on the contralateral side during movement . assessment of neck rotation movement in patients with fhp should take into consideration lateral flexion in the frontal plane and contralateral scm activation .', 13], ['Summarise this text in 5 bullet-points: the perioperative period of major oncological surgery is marked by several potential causes for renal injury such as hypotension , volume depletion , self - regulation disorders of the kidney , surgical trauma and drug - induced nephrotoxicity . on the other hand , patients with oncological malignancies are susceptible to various kidney insults that are associated to complications from the disease itself or from its treatment , such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy . thus , surgical stress would potentiate various risk factors to kidney injury previously present in the carriers of malignancies , resulting in increased length of hospitalization , infectious complications , and mortality rates . in the last few years , several researchers have been trying to find serum and urinary biomarkers that could detect earlier or even predict the evolution to acute kidney injury ( aki)failure in patients at risk . neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( n - gal ) is a widely studied early biomarker of ischemia and kidney injury , which allows the identification of patients at a higher risk of kidney injury 48 h before traditional detection methods , thereby allowing the implementation of preventive protective strategies before renal damage becomes irreversible . considering the negative impact of aki among oncology patients , this study intended to assess the efficacy of urinary n - gal as an early biomarker of aki immediately after major oncological surgeries in patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( icu ) . this was a prospective cohort study on consecutive patients diagnosed with solid neoplasia , submitted to elective or emergency surgeries , and admitted in the icu of a cancer hospital . all adult patients ( aged 18 years ) submitted to major oncological surgeries ( abdominal , pelvic , thoracic , or head neck ) were included , since they previously had a normal renal function . the exclusion criteria were : patients with a previous diagnosis of kidney injury or failure ( with or without renal replacement therapy ) , pregnant women , and terminal patients under exclusive palliative support . acute kidney injury diagnosis was defined in accordance with the aki network definition of injury criteria . selected variable data ( age , acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii , n - gal , c - reactive protein - immediate postoperative crp - ipo , serum creatinine - ipo , serum creatinine 1 po , serum urea - immediate po and 1 po , length of hospitalization , operation time , and serum lactate -

defined outcome ( 0-normal ; aki ) . urinary n - gal was measured at the time of admission in the icu using quantitative architect abbott ( chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay ) method . most of the patients ( 77 ) were males , with a mean age of 52.8 years . patients with elevated urinary n - gal had higher apache ii score at admission , with a trend toward higher mean age compared with those with reduced n - gal . there were no differences in gender , site of cancer , or related diseases table 1 . demographic characteristics and clinical outcome of the patients according to urinary n - gal levels overall incidence of po aki was 13.6 . patients with lower levels of urinary n - gal had lower incidence of aki ( lower levels of serum urea and creatinine ) and shorter length of hospitalization in the icu . when patients with or without the development of aki were compared , the urinary n - gal levels were found to be a strong outcome predictor of aki incidence table 2 . the occurrence of aki increased the length of hospitalization in the icu , although it did not increase the mortality rate . univariate analysis of the risk factors and outcomes among patients with or without the development of aki when the kmo test value was 0.5 ( kmo 0.695 ) , it was possible to verify that the variables post oncological surgeries were in accordance with the pca application assumptions , after removing the variables creatinine 1 po , urea 1 po , length of hospitalization , duration of surgery , and lactate -

gal level assessed at admission to the icu was a strong predictor of aki , and patients with higher values of n - gal showed a trend toward higher hospital mortality . neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin , as well as other lipocalins , is expressed biologically in various tissues , such as lungs , spleen , kidney , liver , brain , heart , and testicles , under healthy conditions in humans . but under stress conditions , it is produced by neutrophils and performs complementary functions , by transporting inflammatory substances ( such as prostaglandins and arachidonic acid ) and mediating the action of iron during inflammatory process . therefore , n - gal has possible immunological action during severe acute situations , such as sepsis and trauma . on the other hand , specifically in the kidney tissue , n - gal is upregulated in injuries ( particularly ischemic and by the use of contrast ) . therefore , it is possible to say that plasma n - gal acts like a neutrophil activation biomarker and urinary n - gal acts like a tubular injury marker . however , because of its small size and resistance to degradation , n - gal is easily detected in the blood and urine . therefore , increased urinary n - gal detection could be affected by a kidney process ( aki ) or it might reflect a severe acute systemic inflammatory process ( e. g. sepsis or trauma ) . during differentiation of various human tissues , n - gal may play a role in the genesis and , probably , the growth , proliferation , and diffusion of human neoplasms . major surgeries can themselves result in severe systemic inflammatory process , which intrinsically would lead to higher mortality . n - gal has been shown to be increased during the po period of major cardiac and noncardiac surgeries , correlating with the severity of inflammatory process and mortality , and even in other chronic and acute inflammatory conditions , such as extracorporeal circulation and inflammatory bowel disease . acute kidney injury is common in the po period of major surgeries , with a strong impact on morbi - mortality , particularly in patients with cancer . despite its multifactorial nature , a characteristic feature of aki related to po period is its association with systemic inflammation processes . in the present study , urinary n - gal showed a strong correlation to kidney dysfunction and a tendency toward increase in mortality ( possibly not significant due to an insufficient number of patients ) . in this study , urinary n - gal , besides being clearly an aki predictor , was increased ( although without statistical significance ) in patients who died . n - gal has been associated with unfavorable outcome in critical patients , particularly ( but not exclusively ) in sepsis and systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome ( sirs ) patients . inflammation has an important role in cellular biology and cancer pathophysiology , either in the development and emergence of oncogenic mutations and metastasis formation or host reaction and eventual secondary immunosuppression . moreover , secondary to major surgeries , particularly in patients with cancer , a systemic inflammatory process is triggered , including an immunosuppressive anti - inflammatory response - an activity that could be mediated by n - gal . in the current study , all patients were submitted to moderate to high - risk surgery , with severe po inflammation , as shown by the elevated crp levels . in the current study , age this could only be associated with the intrinsic higher severity of disease in these patients , with higher number of comorbidities and higher aki risk . however , although the literature is not clear regarding the correlation between age and n - gal levels , elderly patients with sirs sepsis present greater inflammatory activity ( determined by biomarkers ) than younger patients . hence , n - gal could hypothetically be a biomarker of age - related inflammatory activity in these patients . the incidence rate of aki ( 13.6 ) and need for renal replacement therapy ( 4.5 ) in this study were compatible with literature . aki incidence varying from 6.8 ( lung cancer ) and 17.3 ( pancreatectomy ) to 38.3 ( esophageal cancer ) has been described in hospitalized oncology patients , with a strong correlation to hospital mortality . in this study , there was a small increase of aki incidence in gastrointestinal surgeries , although without statistical difference . the main predictors of aki were older age , apache ii score , urinary n - gal , and crp , and the first three parameters maintained their predictability when subjected to multivariate analysis . in po patients , it has been shown that aki is correlated with disease severity , previous diseases ( such as chronic heart failure chf and diabetes ) , and abdominal surgery . the crp level in critically ill sepsis cancer patients shows a strong correlation with the course of acute disease , thereby being a good marker of inflammatory process . this study has some limitations , primarily because of a single center design and limited number of subjects . in addition , n - gal serum level was not measured , which could better differentiate between systemic inflammatory process and kidney injury . it has also been shown that urinary n - gal has a strong correlation with mortality and inflammatory process , independent of the presence of aki . the serial measurement of n - gal was not performed , which could increase the predictability of the diagnostic test . in addition , because two variables were studied ( oncological and at po status ) it would be difficult to arrive at conclusions on the relative impact of each one of the parameters involved in the development of aki . in a small cohort of cancer patients submitted to major surgery and admitted to the icu , initial urinary n - gal was a predictor of po aki . patients with elevated urinary n - gal also showed a trend toward higher hospital mortality .

gal was not performed , which could increase the predictability of the diagnostic test . in addition , because two variables were studied ( oncological and at po status ) it would be difficult to arrive at conclusions on the relative impact of each one of the parameters involved in the development of aki . in a small cohort of cancer patients submitted to major surgery and admitted to the icu , initial urinary n - gal was a predictor of po aki . patients with elevated urinary n - gal also showed a trend toward higher hospital mortality .', 14], ['Summarise this text in 10 bullet-points: schistosomiasis is the second most common parasitic infection of humans , following malaria , worldwide.1,2 approximately 207 million people are infected in 76 countries , and about 600 million are exposed to infection in tropical and subtropical regions of africa , asia , south america , and the caribbean . globally , 200,000 deaths are attributed to schistosomiasis annually.13 advances in the fields of molecular biology and epidemiology have led to significant advances in our understanding of the relationship between infectious agents and cancer ; however , the high prevalence of the parasitic infection in the general population , the extended latency , as well as the presence of interacting factors make detection of this relationship difficult.1,4 five species of schistosoma infect humans : s. hematobium , s. mansoni , s. japonicum , s. intercalatum , and s. mekongi.2,4 most human infections are linked to s. haematobium , s. japonicum strongly associated with bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , respectively and s. mansoni , which has been linked to many case reports of liver cancer , colorectal cancer , prostate cancer , and giant follicular lymphomas.4,5 in brazil , schistosomiasis is caused by s. mansoni , and the intermediate hosts are snails of the genus biomphalaria ( b. straminea , b. glabrata , and b. tenagophila).6,7 the immunopathology of s. mansoni infection is due to granuloma formation surrounding the eggs deposited in the tissues , which is a manifestation of the delayed hypersensibility reaction . this reaction leads to pylephlebitis , peripylephlebitis , portal hypertension , splenomegaly , esophageal varices , hematemesis , and death.17 hcc is considered the fifth most common cancer in the world and is responsible for 5 of all malignant tumors in humans . in recent years , the incidence of schistomiasis has risen in many countries , including those in north america , europe , and asia.810 most hcc cases develop in the presence of advanced chronic liver disease related to chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection , chronic hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection , and alcohol abuse.1,2,4,5 the relationship between hcc and s. mansoni has been debated in human cases.4,11,12 the real role of s. mansoni infection in the development of hcc has not been well characterized . the aim of this study was to report a case series of patients with hcc and s. mansoni infection at a single center from january 2002 to january 2015 and to conduct a literature review on the topic . from january 2002 to january 2015 , an institutional database was screened retrospectively to identify patients with hcc and s. mansoni infection at a single center in the department of gastroenterology of university of so paulo school of medicine and hospital das clnicas , brazil . baseline information , including patient demographics , serum biochemistries , liver biopsy when available , severity of liver disease ( child - pugh classification ) , eastern cooperative oncology group performance status ( pst ) , cancer stage according to the barcelona clinic liver cancer ( bclc ) staging system , -fetoprotein level ( afp ) , and treatment modalities , were acquired . diagnosis of s. mansoni infection was made based on positive epidemiology ( coming or visiting from endemic areas with a history of exposure to potentially contaminated water or food ) , history of drug treatment for schistosomiasis or surgery ( splenectomy ) , imaging patterns ( periportal fibrosis , left lobe hypertrophy , or splenomegaly ) , positive stools , andor presence of compatible histological findings ( presence of schistosoma granuloma , portal fibrosis , or obliteration of portal venous branches ) ( fig . 1 ) . a , small portal tract with aberrant veins and obliterative venopathy , suggestive of schistosomiasis ; b , hepatocellular carcinoma , trabecular pattern . hcc was diagnosed according to the updated noninvasive diagnostic criteria of the american association for the study of liver diseases.8 liver histology was performed to confirm diagnosis in inconclusive cases by imaging examination . patients were classified as 0 ( very early ) , a ( early ) , b ( intermediate ) , c ( advanced ) , or d ( terminal ) , using the bclc staging system . curative therapies included surgical resection , liver transplantation , and local ablative therapy , such as radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) or percutaneous ethanol injection . liver transplantation was considered in patients fulfilling the milan criteria and showing increased portal pressure or bilirubin . while waiting on the liver transplant list , patients were treated with percutaneous ablation or transarterial chemoembolization ( tace ) as a bridge therapy to liver transplantation . if hepatectomy or orhtotopic liver transplantation were not indicated , local ablative therapies were performed , depending on the size and number of tumor nodules . in multifocal tumors or large hccs without extra - hepatic spread or vascular invasion , tace was the treatment of choice . sorafenib was indicated for patients with advanced hcc . when treatment efficacy was considered limited or treatment - related risk was substantial due to extensive tumor burden , child - pugh class c status , or other medical comorbidities , supportive care was given . ten cases were initially identified with hcc and s. mansoni infection in our center , however , three cases were excluded : one female patient had a biopsy consistent with budd - chiari syndrome , one male patient had impaired liver function ( child c10 ) , and one male patient who underwent the liver orthotopic transplantation with explant showed liver cirrhosis . a summary of the seven included cases is shown in table 1 and table 2 . afp , alpha -

up , all patients developed tumoral progression and died . schistosomiasis is a major chronic disease of humans in endemic regions.15,13 while the majority of people infected with s. mansoni are relatively asymptomatic or show restricted morbidity associated with intestinal inflammation and fibrosis , a minority of infected individuals develop a severe hepatosplenic schistosomiasis , characterized by hepatic fibrosis , hepatosplenomegaly , and portal hypertension.13 this infection has an extensive transmission area in brazil , with endemic and focal areas encompassing 19 of the 27 federative units states.6,14 the most heavily affected areas are characterized by poor sanitary conditions , poverty , and low education levels , especially in states of the northeast and southeast regions . it is estimated that approximately 2.5 to 6.0 million people are infected ( 5 - 10 may develop severe hepatosplenic and potentially fatal forms ) and that 25 million who live in endemic areas are at risk of infection.14 humans are infected with s. mansoni following exposure to contaminated water ; s. mansoni cercariae infect the host via the penetration of intact skin and become a new form called schistosomulum . after penetrating the wall of a nearby vein , schistosomula are carried in the host s blood , eventually reaching the portal venous system , where they mature and lay eggs , which either lodge into tissues and incite a granulomatous reaction or are released in feces . the eggs hatch in water to form miracidia , which invade snails and are released as cercarie , starting a new cycle.17,13 infections , in general , can initiate or promote carcinogenesis by three main mechanisms : ( a ) chronic inflammation due to prolonged persistence of an infectious agent in the host promotes release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( ros and rnos , respectively ) , which have the potential to damage dna , proteins , and cell membranes , and modulates enzyme activities and gene expression , which can cause carcinogenesis ; ( b ) insertion of oncogenes into the host genome , as in hepatitis b and hepatitis c , inhibition of tumor suppressors , or stimulation of mitosis ; and ( c ) induction of immunosuppression and consequently a reduction in immunosurveillance . parasitic infections that initiate or promote neoplasia usually do so by mechanism one.1,2,4,5,11,15 in our sample , all patients had positive epidemiology for s. mansoni infection , and five ( 71.4 ) previously had ugb or surgery intervention more than 10 years before the hcc diagnosis . previous drug treatment for s. mansoni infection and the long period until the hcc disclosure could explain the negative results for the s. mansoni eggs in stool tests . several surgical techniques have been developed to prevent rebleeding in patients with schistosomiasis and esophageal varices . after isolated splenectomy , much of the portal blood flow is diverted through the left gastric vein into the azygos system . consequently , the liver becomes extremely arterialized with greatly increased sinusoidal pressure , leading to loss of liver function in the long term.16,17 splenectomy and ligature of the left gastric vein has been used in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis since the 1960s in brazil , becoming widespread in the 1990s.17 in our sample , patients underwent splenectomy in external services . based on clinical and surgical data , year of fulfillment , and place the surgery was performed , it was possible to infer that two ( cases 4 and 7 ) of the four patients in our sample underwent ligation of the left gastric vein . the peripheral destruction of the portal vein system with the occlusion or amputation of some of the medium - sized branches account for the presence of portal hypertension . the hepatic arterial changes , with hypertrophy and hyperplasia , are considered compensatory for the diminution of the portal vein flux.18 pvt was identified in five ( 71.4 ) patients , and three ( 42.8 ) of these patients were submitted for splenectomy in the past . studies report that the most frequent immediate complication of esophagogastric devascularization is pvt , with an occurrence rate of 52.3.19 postoperative pvt after splenectomy is a possible , but unusual , complication . however , because many patients remain asymptomatic , the true incidence of pvt may be underestimated . in studies where routine postoperative ultrasonography was done after splenectomy , the incidence of tpv ranged from 6.3 to 10.0.20 in humans , portal deprivation , resulting from portacaval shunt or pvt , has been observed to induce a wide spectrum of liver nodules , including benign liver tumors , such as focal nodular hyperplasia and liver cell adenoma , and malignant tumors , such as hcc and hepatoblastoma , in addition to fibrosis and arterial proliferation in the portal space . the underlying mechanism of these changes remains unclear.21 clinical studies in egypt showed that 70 - 90 of patients with chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hcc are co - infected with schistosomiasis and hcv.15 it was suggested that the combination of chronic schistosomiasis caused by s. mansoni and hbv or hcv may cause a higher risk of hcc due to the increased viral load in co - infected patients , leading to higher inflammatory activity and more advanced disease state.1,2,4,5,15 patients with s. mansoni infection tend to retain hbv and hcv for longer periods than those not infected with s. mansoni.21 in those with hepatosplenomegaly , the cell - mediated immune response was shown to be markedly depressed . schistosoma infection affects the immune response in two ways to prolong the carrier state of the virus . anti - idiotype antibodies produced in patients with chronic schistosomiasis can downregulate specific immune responses and suppress nonspecific immune responses.21,22 in addition , studies with mice and humans have shown that s. mansoni egg antigens can modify subpopulations of thymus helper cells , with an upregulation of helper t cell subtype 2 activity and the cytokines involved and with downregulation of helper t cell subtype 1 activity and cytokines , interleukin-2 , and interferon as well as cytotoxic cd8 t cells.3,4,15,21 therefore , co - infected ( s. mansoni infection and hbv or hcv ) patients are at higher risk for early deterioration of liver function , the development of cirrhosis , and rapid progression towards end - stage liver disease and even hcc.20,21,23 in our sample , there were four ( 57.1 ) patients with immunity by contact for hbv . the possible influence of this result on the disease course of these patients is unknown . a recent experimental study evaluated the role of s. mansoni infection in enhancing and aggravating the carcinogenic effect of diethylnitrosamine , a carcinogenic substance . s. mansoni infection failed to initiate any dysplastic changes.5 regarding the possible association between s. mansoni infection and hcc , studies have indicated that schistosomiasis may act as an additional factor , accelerating the injury related to other agents , such as hbv and hcv.15,2224 there are some limitations of our study . this retrospective analysis of records was performed at a single institution , which did not allow us to generalize these data to the general population . the center is a reference unity for the treatment of hcc , and , thus , most cases were referred after the diagnosis of hcc , and biopsies were directed to the focal lesions with an aim of hcc diagnosis . the clinical history and epidemiological features associated with imaging changes and preserved liver function allowed for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in most cases . however , it is possible that there may be , in addition to the infection with s. mansoni , some degree of chronic liver disease related to vascular changes , in particular chronic portal vein thrombosis andor absence of ligation of the left gastric vein in splenectomized . the sample had few patients , and four ( 57.1 ) of them had immunity by contact for hbv and its meaning is uncertain . the available literature indicates that s. mansoni , in the presence of hbv and hcv infections , likely acts as a cofactor for the hepatic lesion and potentiates injury .

015 - 0094 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . extended spectrum -lactamases ( esbl ) are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing penicillins , broad - spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams . these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously 3 , 4 . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers . however , if one utilizes esbl classification with aztreonam ( atm ) , ceftriaxone ( cro ) , or ceftazidime ( caz ) minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) as a simple screen , without phenotypic confirmation via the clavulanate test , this approach may include other resistant genotypes ( i. e. carbapenemase producers ) that may not accurately predict the clinical utility of therapeutic agents under consideration . phenotypic screening tests to detect resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase production or ampc expression are available and can be used . while molecular testing would yield the most definite results , it is also cost prohibitive and unavailable to most clinical microbiological laboratories . in this study , we tested the recently us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved compound , ceftolozane tazobactam ( c t ) , which has demonstrated in vitro activity against some esbl organisms . the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic - based screening versus confirmatory testing of esbls on the susceptibility profile of c t versus selected antimicrobials . in this study , 44 us hospitals collected non - duplicate , non - urine escherichia coli ( n 1306 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( n 1205 ) over the period of june 2013 and october 2014 . participating sites identified the organisms using their established method and then transferred each isolate to trypticase soy agar slants for shipping . isolates were transferred onto trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 sheep blood at the central processing laboratory ( center for anti - infective research and development , hartford hospital , hartford hospital , hartford , ct , usa ) for mic determination using broth microdilution as described by clsi . mics were determined for c t , cefepime ( fep ) , cro , caz , ciprofloxacin ( cip ) , atm , ertapenem ( etp ) , piperacillin tazobactam ( tzp ) , meropenem ( mem ) , and tobramycin ( tob ) against this collection of 2511 contemporary clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates . c t was provided by cubist pharmaceuticals , while all others antibiotics were purchased from sigma -

spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams . these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously 3 , 4 . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers . however , if one utilizes esbl classification with aztreonam ( atm ) , ceftriaxone ( cro ) , or ceftazidime ( caz ) minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) as a simple screen , without phenotypic confirmation via the clavulanate test , this approach may include other resistant genotypes ( i. e. carbapenemase producers ) that may not accurately predict the clinical utility of therapeutic agents under consideration . phenotypic screening tests to detect resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase production or ampc expression are available and can be used . while molecular testing would yield the most definite results , it is also cost prohibitive and unavailable to most clinical microbiological laboratories . in this study , we tested the recently us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved compound , ceftolozane tazobactam ( c t ) , which has demonstrated in vitro activity against some esbl organisms . the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic -

mean - square ( rms ) data . to normalize emg data of the trunk muscles , reference voluntary contraction ( rvc ) data of trunk muscles were collected when subjects were seated on a chair in a comfortable sitting posture with 90 of hip and knee flexion for 40 s. the rvc maneuver was repeated three times , and the mean value of the average muscle activity for the middle 30 s of the three trials was used to normalize trunk muscle activity . prior to vdt work , a laptop ( xnote r400 , lg , seoul , korea ) was placed on a 73-cm -

legged sitting ; however , these differences in hip flexion rom did not influence emg activity in trunk muscles . the lumbo - pelvic - hip complex is connected via a kinematic link termed the lumbo - pelvic rhythm7 , 12 . during forward bending , the lumbar spine is flexed anteriorly with respect to the pelvis , while the pelvis is flexed anteriorly on the femur12 . when lumbar flexion is limited , greater hip flexion is required with pelvic anterior tilt throughout the lumbo - pelvic rhythm7 . in other words , greater lumbar flexion is caused throughout the pelvic posterior tilt when hip flexion is limited . the results of our study imply that greater lumbar flexion compensated for insufficient hip flexion in subjects in the experimental group during vdt work with cross - legged sitting . despite significant differences in lumbar flexion between the experimental and control groups , emg activity in the trunk muscles was not significantly different between the two groups . snijders et al.8 reported that the cross - legged sitting position decreased emg activity in io muscles due to increased stability in the sacroiliac joint . the cross - legged sitting posture is performed by the combined motion of hip flexion and adduction . increased tension in the biceps femoris , gluteus maximus and piriformis by hip flexion and abduction influences sacroiliac joint compression and tension in the sacrotuberous ligament , which can contribute to increased stability in the sacroiliac joint13,14,15 . although the hip flexion angle may have been influenced by differences in hip flexion rom in subjects in this study , sufficient hip adduction may have been possible for all subjects during vdt work with cross - legged sitting . we suggest that the sacroiliac joint compression by hip adduction during cross - legged sitting may not differ between subjects with and without limited hip flexion rom , resulting in the absence of significant differences in emg activity in trunk muscles between the two groups . first , our study included a small sample size ; therefore , it is difficult to generalize our results . however , a previous study by lee et al.5 showed that trunk kinematics were immediately changed after assuming a cross - legged sitting posture during vdt work , and the trunk flexion angle then did not significantly change for 30 min . based on previous findings , we consider that the kinematic data of the lumbar spine and emg data of the trunk muscles during vdt work with cross - legged sitting for short periods may provide meaningful information for individuals who prefer cross - legged sitting .

mean - square ( rms ) data . to normalize emg data of the trunk muscles , reference voluntary contraction ( rvc ) data of trunk muscles were collected when subjects were seated on a chair in a comfortable sitting posture with 90 of hip and knee flexion for 40 s. the rvc maneuver was repeated three times , and the mean value of the average muscle activity for the middle 30 s of the three trials was used to normalize trunk muscle activity . prior to vdt work , a laptop ( xnote r400 , lg , seoul , korea ) was placed on a 73-cm - high desk , and subjects sat on a height - adjustable chair without a backrest with 90 of hip and knee flexion . the examiner confirmed the 90 hip and knee flexion position using a goniometer . for vdt work with a cross - legged sitting posture , subjects were instructed to cross the right leg over the left by putting the right knee on the left knee5 , 8 . following cross - legged sitting , subjected performed typing work in which they copied some text provided on the monitor by the korean version of hansoft . the subjects typed for 1 min for each trial , and three test trials were conducted with 30-s rest periods between trials . the average values of the lumbar flexion angle and emg activity of the trunk muscles for the middle 40 s of each trial were collected , and the mean values of three test trials were used for data analysis . the subjects characteristics ( age , height , weight , hip flexion rom ) , lumbar flexion angle and trunk muscle activity during vdt work with cross -

legged sitting ; however , these differences in hip flexion rom did not influence emg activity in trunk muscles . the lumbo - pelvic - hip complex is connected via a kinematic link termed the lumbo - pelvic rhythm7 , 12 . during forward bending , the lumbar spine is flexed anteriorly with respect to the pelvis , while the pelvis is flexed anteriorly on the femur12 . when lumbar flexion is limited , greater hip flexion is required with pelvic anterior tilt throughout the lumbo - pelvic rhythm7 . in other words , greater lumbar flexion is caused throughout the pelvic posterior tilt when hip flexion is limited . the results of our study imply that greater lumbar flexion compensated for insufficient hip flexion in subjects in the experimental group during vdt work with cross - legged sitting . despite significant differences in lumbar flexion between the experimental and control groups , emg activity in the trunk muscles was not significantly different between the two groups . snijders et al.8 reported that the cross - legged sitting position decreased emg activity in io muscles due to increased stability in the sacroiliac joint . the cross - legged sitting posture is performed by the combined motion of hip flexion and adduction . increased tension in the biceps femoris , gluteus maximus and piriformis by hip flexion and abduction influences sacroiliac joint compression and tension in the sacrotuberous ligament , which can contribute to increased stability in the sacroiliac joint13,14,15 . although the hip flexion angle may have been influenced by differences in hip flexion rom in subjects in this study , sufficient hip adduction may have been possible for all subjects during vdt work with cross - legged sitting . we suggest that the sacroiliac joint compression by hip adduction during cross - legged sitting may not differ between subjects with and without limited hip flexion rom , resulting in the absence of significant differences in emg activity in trunk muscles between the two groups . first , our study included a small sample size ; therefore , it is difficult to generalize our results . however , a previous study by lee et al.5 showed that trunk kinematics were immediately changed after assuming a cross - legged sitting posture during vdt work , and the trunk flexion angle then did not significantly change for 30 min . based on previous findings , we consider that the kinematic data of the lumbar spine and emg data of the trunk muscles during vdt work with cross - legged sitting for short periods may provide meaningful information for individuals who prefer cross - legged sitting .', 17], ['Summarise this text in 10 sentences.\\n Text: urinary tract infections ( utis ) are one of the inflammatory diseases produced by high multiplication of many pathogens in the urinary apparatus , resulting in alterations in the perfect function of the urinary tract and kidneys . uti is particularly a major problem for females ; nearly 5080 of the female population endures from uti at least once in lifetime and 20 -

30 cmh2o , a tidal volume of 50 - 80 ml , and oxygen saturation of 100 were maintained during the procedure , and the battery was removed . after the removal of the battery , the vital signs were blood pressure 9669 mmhg , heart rate 152 beats min , and 100 oxygen saturation . the patient was not extubated but moved to postoperative intensive care , and after pediatrics observed vital signs for about 3 hours to verify that there were no abnormalities , extubation was done . subsequent vital sign checks and physical exam were normal , and there were no abnormalities found in the blood test . moreover , the right main bronchus appeared on the screen in the postoperative esophagography ( fig . 3 ) , and the chest ct scan found tef at 1.4 cm in the upper carina ( fig . 4 ) . the guardian wanted to have surgery for tef at another hospital ; therefore , 3 days after the surgery , she was transferred . ingested batteries usually pass through the gastrointestinal tract and are defecated in a few days , but when it is caught in the esophagus , the moist environment of the esophagus allows for the discharge of substances inside the battery together with electrical discharges , which can cause tissue damage of the esophagus . in addition , necrosis can develop in the mucus membrane of the esophagus due to the pressure from the battery , and these can trigger complications such as esophageal burns , perforation , and tef . more severe complications arose in cases where the diameter of the battery was larger than 20 mm and the infant was younger than 4 years old . the main factors that cause severe complications in battery ingestion were the size ( larger than 20 - 30 mm ) and components of the battery . especially if the negative terminal of the battery is attached to the tissue , it can lead to more severe results . in addition , lithium batteries cause the most severe damages , and it was reported that in a dog  is esophagus , necrosis developed in the trachea within an hour . in this case study , the corroded battery and inflamed mucous membrane of the esophagus were confirmed in endoscopy before the surgery , but tef could not be tested and confirmed due to the urgency of the surgery . it is reported that esophageal burns start 4 hours after battery ingestion and perforations that form fistulas start in 6 hours . since the estimated ingestion period for this case was 3 days , it is enough time for tef to develop . the infant in this case study did not have respiratory difficulties before of the surgery , but ventilation failure during the surgery was because the endotracheal tube was fixed at 11 cm at first . the tef located approximately 2.6 cm under the end of the endotracheal tube allowed the inhalation gas for the anesthesia to flow into the stomach leading to abdominal inflation , and consecutively , the air injected for the endoscopic surgery flowed over to the respiratory tract to greatly increase the airway pressure . afterwards , when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply into the carina , the tube was located past the tef so the influence of tef was eliminated for the decrease in airway pressure . when there is tef , it is important to position the endotracheal tube above the carina and below the tef to maintain anesthesia . this is because effective ventilation would not happen due to a loss of the tidal volume through the fistulous openings in the tef , the contents of the stomach being aspirated into the lungs , and excessive positive pressure ventilation when inducing anesthesia can cause abdominal inflation and cardiovascular suppression . however , in our case , ventilation was not completely recovered even when the endotracheal tube was inserted deeply to eliminate the influence of tef , and this is thought to be from accompanying ventilation failure from the endoscope . this ventilation failure can be caused by pressure on the pharynx and the trachea from the weight of the endoscope , or motor abnormality of the diaphragm due to abdominal inflation from the injected air . wengrower et al . reported that approximately 7 of infants who had endoscopic procedures under sedation or anesthesia exhibited temporary desaturation . there are reports that an infant with a similar height and weight developed ventilation failure from a tee probe with outer diameter of 10 8 mm . in our case , the fact that direct pressure on the respiratory tract was applied by using an adult endoscope with a 9 mm diameter and that air had to be injected continually since the battery had attached itself to the esophagus and was hard to remove could have been some other causes for the excessive airway pressure , ventilation failure , and hypoxemia . when upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures were done on 99 infants of 0.9 - 10.1 kg using an endoscope with a 5.2 mm outer diameter , only 1 infant with global developmental delay exhibited hypoxemia , and gryboski recommended using endoscopes with a 5 mm outer diameter on infants with esophageal diseases . it is important to use pediatric endoscopes with the smallest possible outer diameters to prevent hypoxemia during endoscopic procedures on infants . since the removal of foreign objects in the esophagus of infants are usually done under general anesthesia , anesthesiologists need to anticipate ventilation failure and hypoxemia from the physical pressure from the procedural equipment and the excessive injection of air and proceed with anesthesia under close cooperation with the operating surgeon . especially when a battery has been ingested , it is necessary to be aware that there could be complications such as tef in the location where the battery is depending on the battery  is components , size , and ingestion period . in addition , to more effectively block the mutual flow of air and anesthetic gas towards either the esophagus or the trachea in the case of a potential tef , a cuffed endotracheal tube should be chosen preferentially and special caution should be taken to fix the position of the tube and in selecting a suitable size for the endoscope used in the procedure .

invasive blood pressure ( nibp ) , and a pulse oximetry , and before anesthesia , her blood pressure was 8561 mmhg ; her heart rate was 160 beats min with 100 oxygen saturation . 10 mg of ketamine was iv injected and after loss of consciousness , 5 mg of rocunium was iv injected . when the muscles were sufficiently relaxed , an uncuffed endotracheal tube with a 4 mm inside diameter was intubated . after intubation , both lungs were checked through a stethoscope and found to be normal , and the endotracheal tube was set to 11 cm in accordance with the top front teeth . anesthesia was maintained by 2 l min of air , 2 l min of o2 , and 2.0 - 3.5 vol of sevoflurane . the tidal volume was 90 ml ; respiratory rate was 18min through volume - controlled mechanical ventilation to maintain an end - tidal co2 ( etco2 ) pressure of 35 - 40 mmhg and the peak inspiratory pressure ( pip ) at this point was 19 cmh2o . an adult endoscope with a 9 mm outer diameter was used for the removal procedure because the hospital did not have a pediatric endoscope with forceps . 2 minutes after inserting the endoscope , severe abdominal inflation was observed , and pip increased up to 28 - 30 cmh2o with the tidal volume decreasing to less than 50 ml . the battery had caused an inflammatory change and conglutinated onto surrounding tissue in the esophagus , and 3 minutes after inserting the endoscope , oxygen saturation decreased to 80 , and etco2 pressure rose to 70 mmhg therefore the surgery was stopped and the endoscope was removed . by manual ventilation using 100 oxygen , oxygen saturation was recovered to 100 and etco2 pressure to 40 mmhg , and thereafter , the endoscope was reinserted . in the second attempt of the procedure , manual ventilation was done instead of mechanical ventilation . however , 1 minute after the insertion of the endoscope , a sudden strong resistance was felt in the reservoir bag , and the tidal volume was less than 20 ml despite applying more than 35 cmh2o for the pip . oxygen saturation dropped below 60 so the procedure could not be continued ; therefore , the endoscope was removed again . here , a pip of 25 - 30 cmh2o and a tidal volume of 50 ml were maintained . the endoscope was reinserted after recovering oxygen saturation to 100 , but due to the increased airway pressure , ventilation was not possible , and oxygen saturation dropped back down to less than 40 . the authors suspected the possibility of tef considering the period of intake and the excessive air volume seen in the stomach in the chest radiograph taken before the surgery . hence , the endotracheal tube was inserted until one lung ventilation was possible and then retreated while auscultating to secure onto the location where the pulmonary sound from both lungs became equal . the adjusted position of the endotracheal tube was 15 cm based on the top front teeth . a pip of 25 -
