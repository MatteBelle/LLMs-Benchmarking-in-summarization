       "{'prompt': 'Generate a summary 10 times shorter for the following text: low - grade lymphomas are chronic diseases , and some patients may live for many years following initial diagnosis.1 therefore , for many patients it is currently regarded as appropriate not to treat immediately at diagnosis , but rather to watch and wait . once patients do require treatment , there are many therapies available : chemotherapeutic agents known to be effective in low - grade lymphoma include alkylating agents , anthracycline - based regimens , purine analogs , and bendamustine . in addition , there is the established monoclonal antibody therapy rituximab , and newer antibodies such as ofatumumab . patients may also undergo stem - cell transplantation either autologous or allogeneic with or without myeloablation preceding allogeneic transplantation . finally , there is currently a small amount of experience available on the use of techniques such as dna vaccination or antisense therapy . questions about the long - term outcome of following an initial watchful waiting approach have been raised by a recent study , which compared this approach with immediate treatment with rituximab in patients with stage ii , iii or iv asymptomatic follicular lymphoma ( fl).2 the estimated median time to initiation of new therapy among patients in the watchful waiting group was 33 months , whereas among those receiving rituximab the median time was not reached at 4 years ( p0.001 ) . there were also significant differences in progression - free survival between the observation and rituximab arms ( p0.001 ) , although no difference in overall survival . these data indicate that initial treatment with rituximab significantly delays the need for new therapy . this may , in the future , change the management approach to patients with newly - diagnosed fl . it is unclear whether some patients with low - grade lymphoma can be treated with curative intent , particularly as patients at stages i and ii , and some at stage iii ( for example , those with up to five lymph nodes involved ) , can live for a long time after diagnosis . usually treatment is undertaken to manage disease - associated symptoms , such as b symptoms , hematopoietic insufficiency ( e. g. anemia , leukopenia , andor thrombocytopenia ) , rapid tumor progression , or bulky disease . some patients develop phenomena such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as a consequence of their disease , and others may have recurrent infections as a result of hypogamma - globulinemia , all of which require treatment . at this time , combined immuno - chemotherapy with rituximab followed by rituximab maintenance therapy for 2 years is the standard of care for patients with fl ( note that the most appropriate maintenance therapy for all other low - grade lymphomas is currently under investigation ) . what is less clear is the best chemotherapy to combine with rituximab . chemotherapy combinations comprising cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone chop ; or cyclophosphamide , vincristine , and prednisone ( cvp ) are well accepted by clinicians . in addition , chlorambucil - based chemotherapies such as mitoxantrone , chlorambucil , and prednisone ( mcp ) , and some fludarabine - based therapies e. g. fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and mitoxantrone ( fcm ) are commonly used , and bendamustine therapy has been investigated with promising results in these patients . maintenance therapy with rituximab is also the standard of care in patients with low - grade lymphoma . this has been known for some time to be the optimal approach for patients with relapsed disease , and the recent results of the prima study indicate that this is also the most effective treatment strategy for patients with fl after first - line treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy.3 there are currently few data on the use of non - pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( npld ) specifically in low - grade lymphoma . some of the publications available are case series , studies involving only small numbers of patients , or studies of patient populations with aggressive as well as low - grade lymphomas . one retrospective study of 37 patients with lymphomas who were either elderly or had cardiac comorbidities included three with fl , two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and one with multiple myeloma.4 these patients received npld in combination chemotherapy , and experienced a high rate of remission for this poor - risk population complete remission rates were 75 for diffuse large b - cell lymphoma and 55 for t nk - cell neoplasm ;

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants are among the most widely adopted renewable energy sources, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies harness natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other harmful pollutants. As a result, renewable energy has emerged as a key solution to mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. Moreover, the declining costs of renewable energy systems have made them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources, driving widespread adoption and investment in renewable energy infrastructure worldwide.

professor of organic chemistry in 1847 , and later professor of general , anorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry . his work especially concerned quantitative research on blood and urine in pathological conditions . in 1843 he published his book chemische und mikroskopische untersuchungen zur pathologie angestellt an den kliniken des julius - hospitales zu wrzburg ( chemical and microscopic investigations of pathology carried out at the julius clinic at wrzburg ) ( fig . 1 ) , in which he described 72 case reports , giving details on clinical course , diagnosis , and results

filled with purulent and decayed tissue and pus . blood was also obtained directly from the heart during autopsy and lactic acid was found . in this case we could think of a haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage due to clotting disorders possibly resulting from either acute fatty liver of pregnancy hellp syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic microangiopathy ( ttp hus ) or dic . in the conclusions of his 1843 book , scherer attached high importance to the fact that he found lactic acid in cases of puerperal fever , which he had not found before in healthy persons . he held the opinion that lactic acid was formed in blood during bodily deterioration in severe diseases like puerperal fever . lactic acid was thus described for the first time in human blood and was demonstrated for the first time as a symptom of septic and haemorrhagic shock . in the same period a junior obstetrician in vienna , ignaz philipp semmelweis ( 18181865 ) , discovered in 1847 that physicians carried infectious particles on their hands from the mortuary to the obstetrical clinic , causing puerperal fever and puerperal sepsis , and he introduced a successful method for its prevention . louis pasteur ( 18221894 ) found in 1879 that infection with streptococci was the most important cause of puerperal fever . scherer worked closely with the famous pathologist rudolf virchow ( 18211902 ) on several projects ( fig . 2 ) . in 1851 virchow performed an autopsy on a patient who had died from leukaemia and offered scherer blood from this patient for analysis . the results of this analysis were published the same year in the verhandlungen der physikalisch - medicinischen gesellschaft in wrzburg . virchow and scherer had previously studied the spleens of patients who died from leukaemia , and were curious if they could find the same results in the blood . scherer reached the conclusion that : the blood of this patient contains : ameisensure , essigsure und milchsure , die gleichfalls von mir schon frher als in der milzflssigkeit vorkommend bezeichnet wurden ( formic acid , acetic acid , and lactic acid , as also found by me previously in fluids from the spleen ) . 2johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 scherer  is observations inspired others to conduct further research , primarily in patients with leukaemia 1922 , but also in patients with other conditions and diseases and in animal experiments with dogs and rabbits . while scherer found lactic acid in blood obtained after death during autopsy , mosler and krner mention an observation made by carl folwarczny , published in the allgemeinen wiener medicinischen zeitung in 1858 , where blood was withdrawn from a leukaemia patient during life , analysed according to scherer  is method , and found positive for lactic acid . in addition , carl folwarczny described in 1863 in his ' handbuch der physiologischen chemie ' that lactic acid can be found in the blood of patients with leukaemia , septicaemia ( pyaemia ) and in conditions leading to septicaemia like puerperal fever , the latter probably after scherer  is observations . in an extensive article , the berliner physician georg salomon , who had serious doubts that the occurrence of lactic acid in blood was mostly related to leukaemia , proved in 1878 that lactic acid was also present in the blood of patients who were suffering and died from other diseases . he studied blood obtained during autopsy from cadavers , but also blood from patients obtained by bloodletting or cupping , and in some cases he compared the blood before and after death . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in the blood of patients suffering from leukaemia , ( pernicious ) anaemia , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pleuritis , pericarditis , pneumonia and several solid malignant tumours . gaglio is often erroneously mentioned as the first author to find lactic acid in blood 2729 . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in fresh arterial blood withdrawn from dogs and rabbits after bloodletting . both gaglio and berlinerblau , however , neglected previous research , as indignantly described by salomon in 1888 ich erlaube mir , den inhalt meiner arbeiten , die von gaglio nur ganz flchtig , von berlinerblau gar nicht berhrt sind , in krze zu reproduciren ( i take the liberty of summarizing the contents of my work , which was mentioned only briefly by gaglio and not at all by berlinerblau ) . the japanese chemist trasaburo araki showed that the amount of lactic acid in exhausted muscle results from muscle activation . irisawa , inspired by the results obtained by salomon and gaglio , obtained fresh blood of 11 dying patients with serious conditions . in six cases he found hyperlactataemia , in four cases normal values . he speculated on the aetiology of hyperlactataemia , the most plausible cause being the severe hypoxia during the dying process . in an experiment in which he made a dog anaemic for several days , he found a rise in lactic acid levels during the time leading up to death . in cambridge ( uk ) , walter morley fletcher ( 18731933 ) and frederick gowland hopkins ( 18611947 ) worked together on the metabolic changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis under anaerobic conditions , and found that lactate was the product of carbohydrate metabolism . their classic 1907 paper demonstrated rigorously that muscle contraction is accompanied by the anaerobic formation of lactic acid , which is removed aerobically , at a rate depending on the level of exposure to oxygen . poul astrup and john severingshaus mentioned scherer  is 1851 article as first demonstration of lactic acid in blood , but overlooked the 1843 cases and folwarczny  is work . in conclusion , scherer  is 1843 case reports should be cited as the first description of lactic

the degree of the promotion correlated positively with the dose of cyclophosphamide ( figure 2 ) . the involvement of ammonia in the lethal effect was clearly indicated by the accentuation of symptoms which were the characteristic effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . the maximal decrease of the mean survival time has been demonstrated at the background of cyclophosphamide - induced severe neurological disorders . accordingly , the maximal detrimental effect of the redistribution of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia should be expected in heavy exposure to mustard gas , bringing to the development of acute neurological disorders . such cases have been observed in iran - iraqi war as well as in bari harbor accident on december 2nd , 1943 , where first deaths occurred 18 h after the exposure . ammonia gas is very aggressive and cytotoxic until it is converted into ammonium ions , which cells can tolerate at millimolar levels . the ensuing restriction of the cellular energy supply may be potentiated by the draining of the cellular nad pool by the alkylating agent - mediated activation of poly - adp - ribosylation in various cells . hence , the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool might be involved in the development of not only acute neurological disorders but also some other systemic effects . this may explain the shortening by gavages with aa of the mean survival time in rats treated with cyclophosphamide in dose which was not apparently neurotoxic ( 200 mg kg ) . therefore , in rat , the size of the luminal ammonia pool of the digestive tract constitutes one of leading factors contributing to the severe toxicity of cyclophosphamide . in rats , the increase of the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool by the mean of an oral gavage with nonlethal dose of ammonium acetate enhanced the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide while promoting its lethal action . animals , exposed to the combination of toxicants , manifested symptoms which were characteristic of the effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . these data provide the evidence of the detrimental role of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia in the acute high - dose cyclophosphamide toxicity . so , before addressing the challenge of cyclophosphamide myeloablative therapeutic regimens , it is important to consider the possibility of the promotion of the toxic action of cyclophosphamide by digestive tract luminal ammonia .

the degree of the promotion correlated positively with the dose of cyclophosphamide ( figure 2 ) . the involvement of ammonia in the lethal effect was clearly indicated by the accentuation of symptoms which were the characteristic effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . the maximal decrease of the mean survival time has been demonstrated at the background of cyclophosphamide - induced severe neurological disorders . accordingly , the maximal detrimental effect of the redistribution of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia should be expected in heavy exposure to mustard gas , bringing to the development of acute neurological disorders . such cases have been observed in iran - iraqi war as well as in bari harbor accident on december 2nd , 1943 , where first deaths occurred 18 h after the exposure . ammonia gas is very aggressive and cytotoxic until it is converted into ammonium ions , which cells can tolerate at millimolar levels . the ensuing restriction of the cellular energy supply may be potentiated by the draining of the cellular nad pool by the alkylating agent - mediated activation of poly - adp - ribosylation in various cells . hence , the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool might be involved in the development of not only acute neurological disorders but also some other systemic effects . this may explain the shortening by gavages with aa of the mean survival time in rats treated with cyclophosphamide in dose which was not apparently neurotoxic ( 200 mg kg ) . therefore , in rat , the size of the luminal ammonia pool of the digestive tract constitutes one of leading factors contributing to the severe toxicity of cyclophosphamide . in rats , the increase of the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool by the mean of an oral gavage with nonlethal dose of ammonium acetate enhanced the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide while promoting its lethal action . animals , exposed to the combination of toxicants , manifested symptoms which were characteristic of the effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . these data provide the evidence of the detrimental role of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia in the acute high - dose cyclophosphamide toxicity . so , before addressing the challenge of cyclophosphamide myeloablative therapeutic regimens , it is important to consider the possibility of the promotion of the toxic action of cyclophosphamide by digestive tract luminal ammonia .\", 'summary': 'to estimate the influence of the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool on acute toxic effects of cyclophosphamide , the dynamics of blood ammonia , glutamine and urea level , symptoms of toxic action and the survival time have been studied in rats , intraperitoneally treated with cyclophosphamide , at the background of the gavage with non - lethal dose of ammonium acetate ( 12 mmol kg , i. e. 0.35 ld50 ) . ammonium acetate enhanced the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide while promoting its lethal action : the mean survival time decreased 1.5 , 2.1 , 2.8 , or 6.1 times at the background of cyclophosphamide i p doses 200 , 600 , 1000 , or 1400 mg kg , respectively . animals exposed to the combination of toxicants , manifested symptoms which were characteristic of the effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . these data provide the evidence of the detrimental role of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia in the acute high - dose cyclophosphamide toxicity .

rest measurements . this result is similar to that of the present study , in that the thickness of the tra showed a statistically significant increase under both contraction conditions . however , critchely2 noted that because precise contraction of the pfm was difficult when subjects conducted the hollowing motion and contracted the pfm at the same time , there was a possibility that movement of the pfm did not occur or that subjects concentrated more on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles drawing in the lower abdomen than on the contraction of the pfm . this could explain our result , that the thickness of the tra increased less during the precise contraction of the pfm with visual feedback than during the contraction of the pfm without visual feedback . due to the pfm s anatomical location and structure , it is hard to voluntarily conduct precise contraction of the pfm . this may result in the iliacus muscle , the abductor muscle inside the hip joint , and the abdominal muscles , in particular the tra and the io , contracting together , rather than a contraction of the pfm9 , 15 . therefore , we presume that when subjects conduct the hollowing motion without precisely performing the contraction of the pfm , they concentrate on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles , such as the tra , which affects the thickness of the tra . this study verified that there is an increase in the thickness of the tra during pfm contraction , but that the increase in the thickness of the tra was smaller during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback . we speculate that this is likely because the precise contraction of the pfm decreases mobilization of the deep muscles reducing the simultaneous contraction rate of the tra . training to strengthen the pfm may be an effective exercise for improving continence . however , if the purpose is to strengthen the tra simply for the stabilization of the lumbopelvic girdle , hollowing with visual feedback is not an efficient exercise method for the pfm .

rest measurements . this result is similar to that of the present study , in that the thickness of the tra showed a statistically significant increase under both contraction conditions . however , critchely2 noted that because precise contraction of the pfm was difficult when subjects conducted the hollowing motion and contracted the pfm at the same time , there was a possibility that movement of the pfm did not occur or that subjects concentrated more on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles drawing in the lower abdomen than on the contraction of the pfm . this could explain our result , that the thickness of the tra increased less during the precise contraction of the pfm with visual feedback than during the contraction of the pfm without visual feedback . due to the pfm s anatomical location and structure , it is hard to voluntarily conduct precise contraction of the pfm . this may result in the iliacus muscle , the abductor muscle inside the hip joint , and the abdominal muscles , in particular the tra and the io , contracting together , rather than a contraction of the pfm9 , 15 . therefore , we presume that when subjects conduct the hollowing motion without precisely performing the contraction of the pfm , they concentrate on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles , such as the tra , which affects the thickness of the tra . this study verified that there is an increase in the thickness of the tra during pfm contraction , but that the increase in the thickness of the tra was smaller during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback . we speculate that this is likely because the precise contraction of the pfm decreases mobilization of the deep muscles reducing the simultaneous contraction rate of the tra . training to strengthen the pfm may be an effective exercise for improving continence . however , if the purpose is to strengthen the tra simply for the stabilization of the lumbopelvic girdle , hollowing with visual feedback is not an efficient exercise method for the pfm .', 'summary': 'purpose the purpose of this study is to verify whether precise contraction of the pelvic floor muscle ( pfm ) using visual feedback actually affects the thickness of abdominal muscles . subjects the subjects were 29 healthy adults in their 20s who consented to participate in this study . methods this study provided visual feedback on pfm using one ultrasound device and identified changes in the transversus abdominis ( tra ) using another ultrasound device . abdominal muscle thicknesses were measured by ultrasound under three conditions ( rest , pfm contraction , pfm contraction with visual feedback ) . results there were no statistically significant differences in the external oblique ( eo ) and internal oblique ( io ) muscles between the measurements taken at rest and during the contraction of the pfm , and between those taken at rest and during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback . there were significant differences in the tra . in particular , tra thickness was highest in the order of pfm contraction , pfm contraction with visual feedback , and rest . conclusion hollowing with visual feedback is not an efficient stabilization exercise method for the pfm .

dominant changes in the inflammation . in addition , this subtype is not fully resolved by conventional long - term macrolide therapy combined with surgical dissection of the mucosal membrane in the sinuses . these cases have recently been classified as ecrs because they have different clinical characteristics from the more common crss that are associated with asthma , elevation of eosinophilic counts in peripheral blood , and massive invasion of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa . the diagnosis of ecrs is finally determined by the clinical findings of chronic nasal symptoms , results of imaging tests , peripheral blood tests , and histological tests.4 our case had the nasal symptoms , history of nasal polypectomy , and asthma . ct showed pan - sinusitis , and histopathological examination of removed mucosal membranes showed intensive invasion of eosinophils . furthermore , there was a recurrence after surgery and steroid therapy . from the findings and clinical course , our case was diagnosed as ecrs and not the purulent type of crs . unlike the purulent type of crs , the ocular complications of ecrs have not been fully determined . garg et al reported a case of ecrs associated with optic neuropathy.5 the mri images showed a high intensity area over the left intraorbital optic nerve without any lesions in the paranasal sinuses . they treated their case with steroid therapy and radical sphenoethmoid clearance , however the visual acuity , which was light perception before treatment , improved only slightly to finger counting . fungi have received much attention in the united states as candidates for causing ecrs and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis ( afs ) . the diagnostic criteria for afs include type 1 hypersensitivity to fungi , nasal polyps , and eosinophilic mucin containing fungi.7 it was suggested that fungi in the sinonasal mucosa might be the cause of non - atopic eosinophilia or local ige production.8 the clinical findings of afs overlap those of ecrs , and thus it is necessary to differentiate afs from ecrs . generally , cases with afs have unilateral lesions , elevation of eosinophils , and ige specific to fungal antigen . the important findings for diagnosis of afs are the detection of hyphal forms of fungi and positive histopathological findings with pas or grocott staining . as with ecrs , afs is rarely associated with optic neuropathy.6 the orbital findings of afs are proptosis , ophthalmoplegia , optic neuropathy , and telecanthus . imaging tests show hyper - attenuating foci along with expansion and destruction of the sinus walls . most cases of optic neuropathy have an erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid and optic canal.6 the incidence of bony erosion in afs is more than 12 times greater than in non - afs.9 whether an erosion of sphenoid bone occurs may determine the visual prognosis . there is potential for mistaking the size of the lesion with only mri.10 mri of cases with allergic aspergillus sinusitis showed that the lesions were low intensity cystic lesions in both t1 and t2 weighted images . thus , the lesions may appear to be smaller than the actual size unless enhanced mri is used . by contrast , ct can accurately detect the area of hyper - attenuation and bone architecture . our case progressed to bilateral lesions , and the laboratory data were negative for ige specific to fungi . in addition , there were no hyphae in the biopsy sections with pas and grocott staining . from these findings it was not definitively determined why the visual acuity did not recover even though the ess was performed within 30 hours after the initial symptoms of optic neuropathy developed . our case presented with pan - sinusitis and thick mucosal membrane overall of the rhinosinus including the middle meatus and osteomeatal complex . although the inflammatory changes gradually enlarged after the polypectomy , the drainage from the parasinus might have been blocked leading to infection and inflammatory changes . these changes could then cause the internal pressure in the parasinus to increase and affect the optic canal , even though bacterial infectious changes were not detected . in addition , local ischemia of the optic nerve might also have occurred secondary to the erosion of the optic canal followed by swelling of the optic nerve because the visual loss was so rapid . an earlier case of ecrs with optic neuropathy had a different mri performed and an enhancement of the intraorbital optic nerve without extensive opacification of the rhinosinus was found . although we did not do mri , direct invasion by inflammatory tissues might have occurred in the right optic nerve as seen in the previous case . in conclusion , we documented a rare case of ecrs complicated by optic neuropathy . unfortunately , the visual acuity did not recover at all even though emergency ess and steroid therapy were performed . these findings indicate that it is very important to suppress the allergic reaction for the prevention of ocular complications in ecrs cases .

sinusitis , and histopathological examination of removed mucosal membranes showed intensive invasion of eosinophils . furthermore , there was a recurrence after surgery and steroid therapy . from the findings and clinical course , our case was diagnosed as ecrs and not the purulent type of crs . unlike the purulent type of crs , the ocular complications of ecrs have not been fully determined . garg et al reported a case of ecrs associated with optic neuropathy.5 the mri images showed a high intensity area over the left intraorbital optic nerve without any lesions in the paranasal sinuses . they treated their case with steroid therapy and radical sphenoethmoid clearance , however the visual acuity , which was light perception before treatment , improved only slightly to finger counting . fungi have received much attention in the united states as candidates for causing ecrs and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis ( afs ) . the diagnostic criteria for afs include type 1 hypersensitivity to fungi , nasal polyps , and eosinophilic mucin containing fungi.7 it was suggested that fungi in the sinonasal mucosa might be the cause of non - atopic eosinophilia or local ige production.8 the clinical findings of afs overlap those of ecrs , and thus it is necessary to differentiate afs from ecrs . generally , cases with afs have unilateral lesions , elevation of eosinophils , and ige specific to fungal antigen . the important findings for diagnosis of afs are the detection of hyphal forms of fungi and positive histopathological findings with pas or grocott staining . as with ecrs , afs is rarely associated with optic neuropathy.6 the orbital findings of afs are proptosis , ophthalmoplegia , optic neuropathy , and telecanthus . imaging tests show hyper - attenuating foci along with expansion and destruction of the sinus walls . most cases of optic neuropathy have an erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid and optic canal.6 the incidence of bony erosion in afs is more than 12 times greater than in non - afs.9 whether an erosion of sphenoid bone occurs may determine the visual prognosis . there is potential for mistaking the size of the lesion with only mri.10 mri of cases with allergic aspergillus sinusitis showed that the lesions were low intensity cystic lesions in both t1 and t2 weighted images . thus , the lesions may appear to be smaller than the actual size unless enhanced mri is used . by contrast , ct can accurately detect the area of hyper - attenuation and bone architecture . our case progressed to bilateral lesions , and the laboratory data were negative for ige specific to fungi . in addition , there were no hyphae in the biopsy sections with pas and grocott staining . from these findings it was not definitively determined why the visual acuity did not recover even though the ess was performed within 30 hours after the initial symptoms of optic neuropathy developed . our case presented with pan - sinusitis and thick mucosal membrane overall of the rhinosinus including the middle meatus and osteomeatal complex . although the inflammatory changes gradually enlarged after the polypectomy , the drainage from the parasinus might have been blocked leading to infection and inflammatory changes . these changes could then cause the internal pressure in the parasinus to increase and affect the optic canal , even though bacterial infectious changes were not detected . in addition , local ischemia of the optic nerve might also have occurred secondary to the erosion of the optic canal followed by swelling of the optic nerve because the visual loss was so rapid . an earlier case of ecrs with optic neuropathy had a different mri performed and an enhancement of the intraorbital optic nerve without extensive opacification of the rhinosinus was found . although we did not do mri , direct invasion by inflammatory tissues might have occurred in the right optic nerve as seen in the previous case . in conclusion , we documented a rare case of ecrs complicated by optic neuropathy . unfortunately , the visual acuity did not recover at all even though emergency ess and steroid therapy were performed . these findings indicate that it is very important to suppress the allergic reaction for the prevention of ocular complications in ecrs cases .', 'summary': 'we report a case of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis ( ecrs ) associated with optic neuropathy . the visual acuity in the right eye was suddenly reduced to no light perception on awakening in the morning . fundus examination of both eyes on the same day showed no remarkable changes . emergency computed tomography showed pan - sinusitis bilaterally and a partial defect of the sphenoid bone on the right side . from the clinical findings , the case was diagnosed as optic neuropathy associated with chronic sinusitis . endoscopic sinus surgery ( ess ) was performed on the same day , and all of the major sinuses were found to be filled with highly viscous fluid . part of the optic canal had a defect probably due to inflammatory invasion from the adjacent sphenoid bone . steroid therapy was started immediately postoperatively . histopathological examination of excised polyps showed that numerous eosinophils had invaded the polyps but no hyphae were present . the patient reported that he had bronchial asthma and had had nasal polypectomy . six months after the ess and steroid therapy , the patient had a recurrence of the sinusitis . at that time , laboratory examination showed an elevation of total ige and eosinophil numbers . from the clinical findings and course , this case was diagnosed as ecrs accompanied by optic neuropathy . although ecrs rarely has ocular complications , the inflammation can spread and the optic nerve can be affected .

ray , aqueous tb culture , and pcr . tuberculin skin test was not done as our cdc did not identify the significance of ppd in adult who received routine bacille calmette guerin vaccination . the ocular inflammation revolved after systemic steroid , and remained silent even at the presence of tb lymphadenopathy . our speculation is that the presumed ocular sarcoidosis might be triggered by tb antigen in extraocular infection , which reactivated and presented as tb lymphadenopathy 6 years later . tb could occur coincidently or in association with sarcoidosis , continued follow - up is important for patients with ocular sarcoidosis , even in silent case .', 'summary': 'tuberculosis and sarcoidosis share similarity in histopathologic findings and clinically occur in association with each other occasionally . tuberculosis should always be ruled out before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis . but , the diagnosis is often complicated , especially in extrapulmonary cases . here we present a case of bilateral vitreous hemorrhage with uveitis . ocular sarcoidosis was initially diagnosed based on the characteristic ocular findings , negative results on chest radiography , tuberculosis culture , and polymerase chain reaction of aqueous , as well as simultaneous presence of panda and lambda sign on gallium-67 scans . the ocular condition improved after pars plana vitrectomy and systemic steroid therapy . however , tb lymphadenopathy but no recurrent ocular inflammation was found 6 years later . the patient received anti - tb treatment for 6 months thereafter . the eyes remained silent except cataract progression and glaucoma under two medications during this period . in conclusion , tb could occur coincidently or in association with sarcoidosis , continued follow -

operative diagnosis of an appendiceal mucocele is difficult due to the non - specific nature of the findings . the classic clinical features of an obstructive appendiceal mucocele includes right lower quadrant discomfort , a palpable mass , and x - ray findings of a filling defect in the cecum with non - visualization of the appendix . on ct and ultrasonography , a nodular , enhancing lesion in the wall of the mucocele is suggestive of malignant disease . sometimes , it is asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at surgery or during imaging evaluation for another disease . if a mucocele is found , therapy is surgical . the appropriate type of surgical treatment is related to the dimensions and the histology of the mucocele . an appendectomy is used for simple mucoceles or cystadenomas when the appendiceal base is intact . cecal resection is indicated for cystadenomas with a large base , and a right hemicolectomy is recommended for cystadenocarcinomas . the 10-year survival of patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinomas is 65 among patients treated by hemicolectomy , but only 37 among patients treated by appendectomy alone . while several cases of laparoscopic treatment of appendiceal mucoceles have been reported 4 - 8 , many authors suggest that the laparoscopic approach should be avoided because of the increased risk of rupture and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . pseudomyxoma peritonei is caused by spillage and implantation of mucin - secreting cells into the peritoneal cavity . thus , we reasoned that the complication rate of pseudomyxoma peritonei during laparoscopic surgery would be the same as that of open surgery if a minimal - touch technique was utilized . reported the laparoscopic resection of a 12 cm large mucocele using gravity and position during minimal manipulation of the lesion . also reported successful laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele and suggested that conversion to a laparotomy should be considered if the lesion is grasped traumatically or if the tumor clearly extends beyond the appendix . recently , chiu et al . presented a case involving the successful laparoscopic resection of an 8 cm appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma . gonzlez moreno et al . reported a case of an appendiceal mucinous tumor resected by laparoscopy associated with subsequent diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis . they suggested that if distention of the appendiceal lumen is observed laparoscopically , suggesting a mucocele as a possible diagnosis , conversion to open appendectomy may be the most prudent surgical judgment . we performed laparoscopic resections of two appendiceal mucoceles using a laparoscopic bag to retain and retract the mucocele , in addition to using gravity and position , therefore we avoided grasping the tumor directly . the application of laparoscopic surgery has been more widely adopted in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases , and in some cases laparoscopic surgery is currently the standard treatment . in the surgical treatment of appendiceal mucoceles , however , open surgery is currently the standard surgical treatment due to its well - known safety and easy accessibility . the authors are also aware of the possibility of rupture during laparoscopic dissection , and the subsequent fatal complication of pseudomyxoma peritonei . nevertheless , if we can handle the tissue with minimal manipulation , and can secure enough safety by using various laparoscopic instruments , laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele might be an alternative surgical option to open surgery .', 'summary': 'laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucoceles has recently been described , but the safety and efficacy are controversial . we present two cases of laparoscopic mucocelectomies involving 14 and 15 cm cystic masses originating from the appendix . the laparoscopic mucocelectomies were performed using four ports . from the beginning of the procedure , a laparoscopic bag was used to safely contain the mucocele , prevent rupture of the mucocele , and retract the mucocele . an endoscopic stapling device was used to transect the base of the cecum . minimal handling was achieved by gravity and with the use of laparoscopic instruments . laparoscopic appendectomies are widely performed for acute appendicitis , but laparoscopic resection is not routinely performed for an appendiceal mucocele because of the risk of perforation and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . we report two cases of laparoscopic appendiceal mucocelectomies , which were performed safely with laparoscopic instruments and minimal manipulation .

spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams . these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously 3 , 4 . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers . however , if one utilizes esbl classification with aztreonam ( atm ) , ceftriaxone ( cro ) , or ceftazidime ( caz ) minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) as a simple screen , without phenotypic confirmation via the clavulanate test , this approach may include other resistant genotypes ( i. e. carbapenemase producers ) that may not accurately predict the clinical utility of therapeutic agents under consideration . phenotypic screening tests to detect resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase production or ampc expression are available and can be used . while molecular testing would yield the most definite results , it is also cost prohibitive and unavailable to most clinical microbiological laboratories . in this study , we tested the recently us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved compound , ceftolozane tazobactam ( c t ) , which has demonstrated in vitro activity against some esbl organisms . the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic - based screening versus confirmatory testing of esbls on the susceptibility profile of c t versus selected antimicrobials . in this study , 44 us hospitals collected non - duplicate , non - urine escherichia coli ( n 1306 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( n 1205 ) over the period of june 2013 and october 2014 . participating sites identified the organisms using their established method and then transferred each isolate to trypticase soy agar slants for shipping . isolates were transferred onto trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 sheep blood at the central processing laboratory ( center for anti - infective research and development , hartford hospital , hartford hospital , hartford , ct , usa ) for mic determination using broth microdilution as described by clsi . mics were determined for c t , cefepime ( fep ) , cro , caz , ciprofloxacin ( cip ) , atm , ertapenem ( etp ) , piperacillin tazobactam ( tzp ) , meropenem ( mem ) , and tobramycin ( tob ) against this collection of 2511 contemporary clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates . c t was provided by cubist pharmaceuticals , while all others antibiotics were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st . e. coli 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 were utilized as quality control strains as recommended by clsi . clsi states that the initial mic - based esbl screening for e. coli and k. pneumoniae should be performed by evaluating the mic profile of one of the following drugs : cefpodoxime 4 g ml , caz 1 g ml , atm 1 g ml , or cefotaxime 1 g ml . it is noted that the use of more than one of these agents will improve detection of esbls . we defined a positive esbl screen as having an mic of 1 g ml to 2 of the following : atm , cro , or caz . subsequent clsi defined , phenotypic , esbl confirmation studies were undertaken using caz and cefotaxime with and without clavulanate . probable carbapenemase - producing organisms were excluded based on etp ( 1 g ml ) or mem ( 2 g ml ) susceptibility profiles . while molecular - based confirmation of these enzymes would have been definitive , methodologies readily available to the clinical microbiology laboratory were utilized . recently , c t has been approved in the us and susceptibility interpretative criteria have now been provided by the fda of 2 g ml for the enterobacteriaceae . this surveillance program was reviewed by the institutional review board ( irb ) at the coordinating center , hartford hospital . since all samples were collected as part of routine medical care and no interventions were undertaken as a result of this testing , informed consent was deemed unnecessary by the irb . four - hundred and forty - two ( 18 ) isolates e. coli ( n 231 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 211 ) screened positive for esbl production based on mic - based criteria . of these , 274 ( 62 ) isolates e. coli ( n 146 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 128 ) were phenotypically confirmed positive for esbl production . with further exclusion of the 28 ( 10 ) isolates e. coli ( n 13 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 14 ) that demonstrated carbapenem non -

spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams . these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously 3 , 4 . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers . however , if one utilizes esbl classification with aztreonam ( atm ) , ceftriaxone ( cro ) , or ceftazidime ( caz ) minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) as a simple screen , without phenotypic confirmation via the clavulanate test , this approach may include other resistant genotypes ( i. e. carbapenemase producers ) that may not accurately predict the clinical utility of therapeutic agents under consideration . phenotypic screening tests to detect resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase production or ampc expression are available and can be used . while molecular testing would yield the most definite results , it is also cost prohibitive and unavailable to most clinical microbiological laboratories . in this study , we tested the recently us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved compound , ceftolozane tazobactam ( c t ) , which has demonstrated in vitro activity against some esbl organisms . the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic - based screening versus confirmatory testing of esbls on the susceptibility profile of c t versus selected antimicrobials . in this study , 44 us hospitals collected non - duplicate , non - urine escherichia coli ( n 1306 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( n 1205 ) over the period of june 2013 and october 2014 . participating sites identified the organisms using their established method and then transferred each isolate to trypticase soy agar slants for shipping . isolates were transferred onto trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 sheep blood at the central processing laboratory ( center for anti - infective research and development , hartford hospital , hartford hospital , hartford , ct , usa ) for mic determination using broth microdilution as described by clsi . mics were determined for c t , cefepime ( fep ) , cro , caz , ciprofloxacin ( cip ) , atm , ertapenem ( etp ) , piperacillin tazobactam ( tzp ) , meropenem ( mem ) , and tobramycin ( tob ) against this collection of 2511 contemporary clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates . c t was provided by cubist pharmaceuticals , while all others antibiotics were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st . e. coli 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 were utilized as quality control strains as recommended by clsi . clsi states that the initial mic - based esbl screening for e. coli and k. pneumoniae should be performed by evaluating the mic profile of one of the following drugs : cefpodoxime 4 g ml , caz 1 g ml , atm 1 g ml , or cefotaxime 1 g ml . it is noted that the use of more than one of these agents will improve detection of esbls . we defined a positive esbl screen as having an mic of 1 g ml to 2 of the following : atm , cro , or caz . subsequent clsi defined , phenotypic , esbl confirmation studies were undertaken using caz and cefotaxime with and without clavulanate . probable carbapenemase - producing organisms were excluded based on etp ( 1 g ml ) or mem ( 2 g ml ) susceptibility profiles . while molecular - based confirmation of these enzymes would have been definitive , methodologies readily available to the clinical microbiology laboratory were utilized . recently , c t has been approved in the us and susceptibility interpretative criteria have now been provided by the fda of 2 g ml for the enterobacteriaceae . this surveillance program was reviewed by the institutional review board ( irb ) at the coordinating center , hartford hospital . since all samples were collected as part of routine medical care and no interventions were undertaken as a result of this testing , informed consent was deemed unnecessary by the irb . four - hundred and forty - two ( 18 ) isolates e. coli ( n 231 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 211 ) screened positive for esbl production based on mic - based criteria . of these , 274 ( 62 ) isolates e. coli ( n 146 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 128 ) were phenotypically confirmed positive for esbl production . with further exclusion of the 28 ( 10 ) isolates e. coli ( n 13 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 14 ) that demonstrated carbapenem non - susceptible , a left shift in the mic distribution ( i. e. enhanced potency ) against phenotypically confirmed esbl was noted for c t , etp , tzp , and mem ( table 1 ) . figure 1 highlights these screening- and confirmation - based observations for c t and tzp . improvements in s between 8 and 17 were noted for confirmed versus screened - positive esbl isolates for c t , etp , tzp , and mem . ( table 1 ) overall , s of the other -lactams , tob and cip , was poor against phenotypically confirmed esbls . comparing the mic90 values for all esbl mic - based screen - positive versus phenotypically confirmed positive , we observed a reduction of twofold for c t , sixfold for etp , and eightfold for mem ( table 2). table 1percent susceptibility of all agents against mic -

october for either year . low numbers of c. punctatus were collected from may - september , with a sharp increases in numbers observed primarily at the beef farm at tongilchon during october for both 2011 and 2012 . this is the first report for collections of culicoides using mosquito magnet traps that use only heat and co2 as attractants . the addition of other chemical attractants , e. g. octenol , has been shown to repel some species of culicine mosquitoes , while enhancing the collection of others , but the relative attractiveness of this attractant has not been investigated for most species of culicoides . a major difference between mosquito magnet and light traps is that mosquito magnet traps operate continuously without bias toward nocturnal and diurnal active species . this difference , however , indicates that comparative analysis between data obtained from mosquito magnet and light traps should be viewed with caution . biting midges are both nuisance biters and vectors of medical and veterinary important pathogens that impact the economy of the animal industry in the rok . c. nipponensis , and c. punctatus were the most commonly collected species by mosquito magnets during this study and have been associated with the transmission of important livestock pathogens , e. g. fukuoka , aino , and ibaraki viruses , or as biting pests of humans ( c. erairai ) . consequently , surveillance of these and other species of culicoides and associated pathogens are an important part of the veterinary health service to identify relative vector populations , their distributions throughout the rok , and the presence and prevalence of pathogens affecting livestock and poultry . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus in the mosquito magnet collections is similar to findings by cho and chong and kang and yu using new jersey light traps . similarly , lee found that c. punctatus , c. arakawae , and c. tainanus kieffer were the most commonly collected species at inland sites , whereas c. nipponensis and c. sinanoensis tokunaga were the predominant species collected from the south and eastern coastal areas in the rok . recently kim et al . found that c. punctatus and c. arakawae were the dominant species collected from light traps set in 9 cowsheds in the southern part of the rok . the unprecedented predominance of c. erairai and relatively low numbers of c. arakawae in the mosquito magnet traps compared to these and other previous reports may reflect the relative attraction of these species to light and the attractants associated with the mosquito magnet traps . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus at a cowshed at tongilchon agrees with the host preference of these species for cattle . although c. arakawae appears to have a preference for feeding on birds , it also readily feeds on cattle , which would explain its abundance around cowsheds in other reports but not the low numbers collected at the cowshed at tongilchon in this survey . the variable distribution of culicoides spp . over a limited area ( 2 km radius ) demonstrates the focal species abundance due to little understood environmental and host attraction factors . for example , high numbers of c. erairai were observed at the nnsc camp where humans are believed to be the primary host , while c. nipponensis was the primary species collected at daeseongdong and tongilchon where a variety of hosts ( e. g. cattle , dogs , large water birds , and humans ) serve as potential hosts . thus , further studies comparing light and mosquito magnet traps and range of available hosts may reveal differential attraction for different species and assist in surveys targeting particular species . additionally , studies on the geographical and seasonal distributions , host attraction ( e. g. placement of traps near human habitation and poultry , cattle , and swine farms ) , temporal biting activity , pathogen infection rates , and their role as potential vectors of zoonotic pathogens that impact on human and animal health are warranted . although limited , the data presented herein provide a better understanding of the biology , ecology , and environmental parameters that affect relative population abundance of culicoides spp . that can be used to predict potential human and animal health risks and develop and implement mitigation strategies .

october over a 3-year period from 2010 - 2012 . culicoides nipponensis tokunaga was the most commonly collected species ( 42.9 ) , followed by culicoides erairai kono and takahasi ( 29.2 ) , culicoides punctatus ( meigen ) ( 20.3 ) , culicoides arakawae ( arakawa ) ( 3.3 ) , c. pallidulus ( 1.8 ) , and culicoides circumscriptus kieffer ( 1.4 ) , while the remaining 10 species accounted for only 1.1 of all culicoides spp . collected ( table 1 ) . c. nipponensis was the most frequently collected species ( females and males ) at daeseongdong village ( 67.1 ) , and was commonly collected from the nnsc camp ( 35.6 ) , tongilchon ( 33.9 ) , and warrior base ( 19.5 ) . c. erairai was the most frequently collected species at nnsc camp ( 53.6 ) and accounted for 85.1 of c. erairai collected at all 4 sites ( table 1 ) , while c. punctatus was the most frequently collected species at both tongilchon ( 54.4 ) and warrior base ( 28.7 ) . c. nipponensis females demonstrated bimodal capture rates , with large numbers collected during may ( 1,754 , 82.4 ) , june ( 1,479 , 29.5 ) , and then again during september ( 3,332 , 81.7 ) ( table 2 ) . c. erairai was more frequently collected during june ( 2,962 , 59.2 ) and july ( 2,154 , 76.0 ) followed by a sharp decline in numbers collected from august - october . c. punctatus was collected infrequently from may - september ( range , 84 - 372 ) with large numbers only collected during october ( 2,756 , 88.0 ) . overall , low numbers of c. nipponensis were collected during 2011 , while higher numbers were observed during may - june and again during september 2012 at the nnsc camp and daeseongdong ( fig . 2 ) . c. erairai was collected more frequently at the nnsc camp during the months of june - july 2011 and 2012 , with few collected from august - october for either year . low numbers of c. punctatus were collected from may - september , with a sharp increases in numbers observed primarily at the beef farm at tongilchon during october for both 2011 and 2012 . this is the first report for collections of culicoides using mosquito magnet traps that use only heat and co2 as attractants . the addition of other chemical attractants , e. g. octenol , has been shown to repel some species of culicine mosquitoes , while enhancing the collection of others , but the relative attractiveness of this attractant has not been investigated for most species of culicoides . a major difference between mosquito magnet and light traps is that mosquito magnet traps operate continuously without bias toward nocturnal and diurnal active species . this difference , however , indicates that comparative analysis between data obtained from mosquito magnet and light traps should be viewed with caution . biting midges are both nuisance biters and vectors of medical and veterinary important pathogens that impact the economy of the animal industry in the rok . c. nipponensis , and c. punctatus were the most commonly collected species by mosquito magnets during this study and have been associated with the transmission of important livestock pathogens , e. g. fukuoka , aino , and ibaraki viruses , or as biting pests of humans ( c. erairai ) . consequently , surveillance of these and other species of culicoides and associated pathogens are an important part of the veterinary health service to identify relative vector populations , their distributions throughout the rok , and the presence and prevalence of pathogens affecting livestock and poultry . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus in the mosquito magnet collections is similar to findings by cho and chong and kang and yu using new jersey light traps . similarly , lee found that c. punctatus , c. arakawae , and c. tainanus kieffer were the most commonly collected species at inland sites , whereas c. nipponensis and c. sinanoensis tokunaga were the predominant species collected from the south and eastern coastal areas in the rok . recently kim et al . found that c. punctatus and c. arakawae were the dominant species collected from light traps set in 9 cowsheds in the southern part of the rok . the unprecedented predominance of c. erairai and relatively low numbers of c. arakawae in the mosquito magnet traps compared to these and other previous reports may reflect the relative attraction of these species to light and the attractants associated with the mosquito magnet traps . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus at a cowshed at tongilchon agrees with the host preference of these species for cattle . although c. arakawae appears to have a preference for feeding on birds , it also readily feeds on cattle , which would explain its abundance around cowsheds in other reports but not the low numbers collected at the cowshed at tongilchon in this survey . the variable distribution of culicoides spp . over a limited area ( 2 km radius ) demonstrates the focal species abundance due to little understood environmental and host attraction factors . for example , high numbers of c. erairai were observed at the nnsc camp where humans are believed to be the primary host , while c. nipponensis was the primary species collected at daeseongdong and tongilchon where a variety of hosts ( e. g. cattle , dogs , large water birds , and humans ) serve as potential hosts . thus , further studies comparing light and mosquito magnet traps and range of available hosts may reveal differential attraction for different species and assist in surveys targeting particular species . additionally , studies on the geographical and seasonal distributions , host attraction ( e. g. placement of traps near human habitation and poultry , cattle , and swine farms ) , temporal biting activity , pathogen infection rates , and their role as potential vectors of zoonotic pathogens that impact on human and animal health are warranted . although limited , the data presented herein provide a better understanding of the biology , ecology , and environmental parameters that affect relative population abundance of culicoides spp . that can be used to predict potential human and animal health risks and develop and implement mitigation strategies .
