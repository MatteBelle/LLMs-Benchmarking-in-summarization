Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants are among the most widely adopted renewable energy sources, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies harness natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other harmful pollutants. As a result, renewable energy has emerged as a key solution to mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. Moreover, the declining costs of renewable energy systems have made them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources, driving widespread adoption and investment in renewable energy infrastructure worldwide.

p0.0323 ) . progression - free survival ( pfs ) was significantly longer with br ( median pfs 54.8 months ) compared with r - chop ( median 34.8 months ) at a median observation period of 32 months hazard ratio ( hr ) 0.5765 ; 95 confidence interval ( ci ) 0.4292 - 0.7783 ; p0.0002 . similarly , event - free survival was 54 months for br and 31 months for r - chop ( hr 0.6014 ; 95 ci 0.4515 - 0.7845 ; p0.0002 ) . another key measure was the time to next treatment , which had not been reached in the br arm versus a median of 40.7 months with r - chop ( hr 0.5416 ; 95 ci 0.3897 - 0.7491 ; p0.0002 ) . in summary , this study demonstrated that br significantly improved pfs and cr rates , compared with r - chop , in patients with fl , mcl , and wm . the stil study is now underway to investigate the effect of duration of maintenance therapy with rituximab in fl , and the effect of ritux - imab maintenance therapy in other low - grade lymphoma entities . in the nhl 7 - 2008 ( maintain ) study ( nct00877214 ) , patients with fl will be randomized to either 2 or 4 years of rit - uximab maintenance therapy , every 2 months , following br induction therapy in addition , infectious complications can be studied prospectively in this patient population , which is important because it has been reported that rituximab treatment is associated with neutropenia and increases infectious complications.8 another part of the maintain study is designed to investigate the efficacy of maintenance therapy in other forms of low - grade lymphoma . patients with wm , mzl , or mcl will be randomized to either 2 years of maintenance therapy with rit - uximab every 2 months , or 2 years of watch and wait , both following br induction . studies with other agents are also ongoing . as discussed above , combination therapy with bortezomib , npld , fludarabine , and rituximab was shown in a small study to be effective in relapsed mcl.6 the stil nhl 8 - 2010 study plans to further investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with bortezomib in patients with relapsed low - grade lymphomas . lenalido - mide is another promising therapy in low - grade lymphomas , which has demonstrated good results in patients with several lymphoma types , in hard - to - treat relapsed or refractory disease . low - grade lymphomas will become chronic diseases , and many patients will require treatment over long periods of time , with many treatment cycles . r - chop is commonly used to treat low - grade lymphoma , though chlorambucil- and fludarabine - based regimens are also used . the efficacy and toxicity of r - chop may be improved by substitution of npld into this combination , although data on the use of liposomal doxorubicin are currently more focused on aggressive lymphomas . br therapy has produced promising results in several types of low - grade lymphoma , both in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes , and is recommended in the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) clinical practice guidelines in oncology ( v 1.2011 ) as first - line therapy for indolent lymphoma.11 the use of rituximab maintenance treatment after br induction is currently under investigation in different lymphoma types . in addition , the efficacy of a combination treatment of bortezomib and br will be studied .

reymond ( 18181896 ) published several articles on the influence of lactic acid on muscle contraction 59 . araki and zillessen found that if they interrupted oxygen supply to muscles in mammals and birds , lactic acid was formed and increased 1014 . this was the first demonstration of the relationship between tissue hypoxia and the formation of lactate . the occurrence of increased lactic acid in blood ( hyperlactataemia ) nowadays reflects severe illness , in which the increased blood lactate levels may result from both anaerobic and aerobic production or from a decreased clearance . it was the german physician chemist johann joseph scherer who first demonstrated the occurrence of lactic acid in human blood under pathological conditions after death in 1843 and 1851 15 , 17 , and carl folwarczny in 1858 who first demonstrated lactic acid in blood of a living patient . in this article we wish to honour scherer  is forgotten observations and describe the influence of his finding on further research on lactic acid at the end of the 19th century . born on 18 march 1814 in aschaffenburg , germany , scherer studied medicine , chemistry , geology and mineralogy at the university of wrzburg between 1833 and 1836 . he obtained his phd in medicine and surgery in 1838 with a thesis entitled versuche ber die wirkung einiger gifte auf verscheidene thierclassen he practised medicine in wipfeld , but inspired by the chemist ernst von bibra ( 18061878 ) he completed his studies in chemistry at the university of munich between 18381840 . in 1840 he was employed at the laboratory of justus liebig at giessen , and became professor at the medical faculty in 1842 , professor of organic chemistry in 1847 , and later professor of general , anorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry . his work especially concerned quantitative research on blood and urine in pathological conditions . in 1843 he published his book chemische und mikroskopische untersuchungen zur pathologie angestellt an den kliniken des julius - hospitales zu wrzburg ( chemical and microscopic investigations of pathology carried out at the julius clinic at wrzburg ) ( fig . 1 ) , in which he described 72 case reports , giving details on clinical course , diagnosis , and results obtained during autopsy and analysis of body fluids . in one chapter in his 1843 book entitled ' untersuchungen von krankhaften stoffen bei der i m winter 18421843 in wrzburg und der umgegend herrschenden puerperal - fieber - epidemie ' ( investigations of pathological substances obtained during the epidemic of puerperal fever which occurred in the winter of 18421843 in and around wrzburg ) scherer described the cases of seven young women who all died peripartum . one of the women , the 23-year - old primipara eva rumpel , gave birth to a healthy child on 9 january 1843 . the same night she developed a painfully swollen abdomen and became ill , feverish , and sweaty , with rapid pulse and severe thirst . the next evening she deteriorated , became delirious , with anxious breathing , a tense abdomen , cold extremities and rapid pulse , finally losing consciousness . a. m. 36 h after the onset of the first symptoms , she died . during autopsy , severe purulent endometritis , vaginal pus , pulmonary oedema , and shock liver and shock spleen were found . the blood that was obtained directly from the heart was chemically analysed , in which lactic acid was found . most likely this unfortunate woman had died from a fulminant septic shock caused by group a haemolytic streptococci ( streptococcus pyogenes ) . another patient , the 28-year - old , 7 months pregnant ( second pregnancy ) margaretha glck , was , after being icteric , nauseous , vomiting and complaining about epigastric pain for 8 days , admitted to the lying - in birth clinic on 6 february 1843 . four days later she was transferred to the hospital with severe nosebleeds and generalised exanthema or purpura . in the evening she suffered from severe gastric bleeding and epistaxis , showing rapid pulse , cold extremities and dizziness . the next morning , she was transferred back to the birth clinic , where she gave birth to a premature child ( 30 weeks ) and suffered from a severe post - partum fluxus . she was again transferred to the hospital with the following symptoms : cold clammy skin , tachycardia , severe lochia and persistent exanthema or purpura , but without signs of an acute abdomen . during the night of february 11 autopsy revealed a small intracerebral haematoma , normal lungs without pulmonary oedema , ascites and an anaemic , foul smelling uterus filled with purulent and decayed tissue and pus . blood was also obtained directly from the heart during autopsy and lactic acid was found . in this case we could think of a haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage due to clotting disorders possibly resulting from either acute fatty liver of pregnancy hellp syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic microangiopathy ( ttp hus ) or dic . in the conclusions of his 1843 book , scherer attached high importance to the fact that he found lactic acid in cases of puerperal fever , which he had not found before in healthy persons . he held the opinion that lactic acid was formed in blood during bodily deterioration in severe diseases like puerperal fever . lactic acid was thus described for the first time in human blood and was demonstrated for the first time as a symptom of septic and haemorrhagic shock . in the same period a junior obstetrician in vienna , ignaz philipp semmelweis ( 18181865 ) , discovered in 1847 that physicians carried infectious particles on their hands from the mortuary to the obstetrical clinic , causing puerperal fever and puerperal sepsis , and he introduced a successful method for its prevention . louis pasteur ( 18221894 ) found in 1879 that infection with streptococci was the most important cause of puerperal fever . scherer worked closely with the famous pathologist rudolf virchow ( 18211902 ) on several projects ( fig . 2 ) . in 1851 virchow performed an autopsy on a patient who had died from leukaemia and offered scherer blood from this patient for analysis . the results of this analysis were published the same year in the verhandlungen der physikalisch - medicinischen gesellschaft in wrzburg . virchow and scherer had previously studied the spleens of patients who died from leukaemia , and were curious if they could find the same results in the blood . scherer reached the conclusion that : the blood of this patient contains : ameisensure , essigsure und milchsure , die gleichfalls von mir schon frher als in der milzflssigkeit vorkommend bezeichnet wurden ( formic acid , acetic acid , and lactic acid , as also found by me previously in fluids from the spleen ) . 2johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 scherer  is observations inspired others to conduct further research , primarily in patients with leukaemia 1922 , but also in patients with other conditions and diseases and in animal experiments with dogs and rabbits . while scherer found lactic acid in blood obtained after death during autopsy , mosler and krner mention an observation made by carl folwarczny , published in the allgemeinen wiener medicinischen zeitung in 1858 , where blood was withdrawn from a leukaemia patient during life , analysed according to scherer  is method , and found positive for lactic acid . in addition , carl folwarczny described in 1863 in his ' handbuch der physiologischen chemie ' that lactic acid can be found in the blood of patients with leukaemia , septicaemia ( pyaemia ) and in conditions leading to septicaemia like puerperal fever , the latter probably after scherer  is observations . in an extensive article , the berliner physician georg salomon , who had serious doubts that the occurrence of lactic acid in blood was mostly related to leukaemia , proved in 1878 that lactic acid was also present in the blood of patients who were suffering and died from other diseases . he studied blood obtained during autopsy from cadavers , but also blood from patients obtained by bloodletting or cupping , and in some cases he compared the blood before and after death . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in the blood of patients suffering from leukaemia , ( pernicious ) anaemia , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pleuritis , pericarditis , pneumonia and several solid malignant tumours . gaglio is often erroneously mentioned as the first author to find lactic acid in blood 2729 . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in fresh arterial blood withdrawn from dogs and rabbits after bloodletting . both gaglio and berlinerblau , however , neglected previous research , as indignantly described by salomon in 1888 ich erlaube mir , den inhalt meiner arbeiten , die von gaglio nur ganz flchtig , von berlinerblau gar nicht berhrt sind , in krze zu reproduciren ( i take the liberty of summarizing the contents of my work , which was mentioned only briefly by gaglio and not at all by berlinerblau ) . the japanese chemist trasaburo araki showed that the amount of lactic acid in exhausted muscle results from muscle activation . irisawa , inspired by the results obtained by salomon and gaglio , obtained fresh blood of 11 dying patients with serious conditions . in six cases he found hyperlactataemia , in four cases normal values . he speculated on the aetiology of hyperlactataemia , the most plausible cause being the severe hypoxia during the dying process . in an experiment in which he made a dog anaemic for several days , he found a rise in lactic acid levels during the time leading up to death . in cambridge ( uk ) , walter morley fletcher ( 18731933 ) and frederick gowland hopkins ( 18611947 ) worked together on the metabolic changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis under anaerobic conditions , and found that lactate was the product of carbohydrate metabolism . their classic 1907 paper demonstrated rigorously that muscle contraction is accompanied by the anaerobic formation of lactic acid , which is removed aerobically , at a rate depending on the level of exposure to oxygen . poul astrup and john severingshaus mentioned scherer  is 1851 article as first demonstration of lactic acid in blood , but overlooked the 1843 cases and folwarczny  is work . in conclusion , scherer  is 1843 case reports should be cited as the first description of lactic acid in human blood and also as the first demonstration of lactic acid as a pathological finding in septic and haemorrhagic shock . folwarczny , in 1858 , was the first to demonstrate lactic acid in blood in a living patient . Summary: \", 'document': \"lactic acid was first found and described in sour milk by the swedish chemist karl wilhelm scheele ( 17421786 ) in 1780 . the swedish chemist jns jakob berzelius ( 17791848 ) found lactic acid in fluid extracted from meat in 1808 2 , 3 , and the german chemist justus von liebig ( 18031873 ) , who established the world  is first school of chemistry at giessen , proved that lactic acid was always present in muscular tissue of dead organisms . in 1859 , emil heinrich du bois - reymond ( 18181896 ) published several articles on the influence of lactic acid on muscle contraction 59 . araki and zillessen found that if they interrupted oxygen supply to muscles in mammals and birds , lactic acid was formed and increased 1014 . this was the first demonstration of the relationship between tissue hypoxia and the formation of lactate . the occurrence of increased lactic acid in blood ( hyperlactataemia ) nowadays reflects severe illness , in which the increased blood lactate levels may result from both anaerobic and aerobic production or from a decreased clearance . it was the german physician chemist johann joseph scherer who first demonstrated the occurrence of lactic acid in human blood under pathological conditions after death in 1843 and 1851 15 , 17 , and carl folwarczny in 1858 who first demonstrated lactic acid in blood of a living patient . in this article we wish to honour scherer  is forgotten observations and describe the influence of his finding on further research on lactic acid at the end of the 19th century . born on 18 march 1814 in aschaffenburg , germany , scherer studied medicine , chemistry , geology and mineralogy at the university of wrzburg between 1833 and 1836 . he obtained his phd in medicine and surgery in 1838 with a thesis entitled versuche ber die wirkung einiger gifte auf verscheidene thierclassen he practised medicine in wipfeld , but inspired by the chemist ernst von bibra ( 18061878 ) he completed his studies in chemistry at the university of munich between 18381840 . in 1840 he was employed at the laboratory of justus liebig at giessen , and became professor at the medical faculty in 1842 , professor of organic chemistry in 1847 , and later professor of general , anorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry . his work especially concerned quantitative research on blood and urine in pathological conditions . in 1843 he published his book chemische und mikroskopische untersuchungen zur pathologie angestellt an den kliniken des julius - hospitales zu wrzburg ( chemical and microscopic investigations of pathology carried out at the julius clinic at wrzburg ) ( fig . 1 ) , in which he described 72 case reports , giving details on clinical course , diagnosis , and results obtained during autopsy and analysis of body fluids . in one chapter in his 1843 book entitled ' untersuchungen von krankhaften stoffen bei der i m winter 18421843 in wrzburg und der umgegend herrschenden puerperal - fieber - epidemie ' ( investigations of pathological substances obtained during the epidemic of puerperal fever which occurred in the winter of 18421843 in and around wrzburg ) scherer described the cases of seven young women who all died peripartum . one of the women , the 23-year - old primipara eva rumpel , gave birth to a healthy child on 9 january 1843 . the same night she developed a painfully swollen abdomen and became ill , feverish , and sweaty , with rapid pulse and severe thirst . the next evening she deteriorated , became delirious , with anxious breathing , a tense abdomen , cold extremities and rapid pulse , finally losing consciousness . a. m. 36 h after the onset of the first symptoms , she died . during autopsy , severe purulent endometritis , vaginal pus , pulmonary oedema , and shock liver and shock spleen were found . the blood that was obtained directly from the heart was chemically analysed , in which lactic acid was found . most likely this unfortunate woman had died from a fulminant septic shock caused by group a haemolytic streptococci ( streptococcus pyogenes ) . another patient , the 28-year - old , 7 months pregnant ( second pregnancy ) margaretha glck , was , after being icteric , nauseous , vomiting and complaining about epigastric pain for 8 days , admitted to the lying - in birth clinic on 6 february 1843 . four days later she was transferred to the hospital with severe nosebleeds and generalised exanthema or purpura . in the evening she suffered from severe gastric bleeding and epistaxis , showing rapid pulse , cold extremities and dizziness . the next morning , she was transferred back to the birth clinic , where she gave birth to a premature child ( 30 weeks ) and suffered from a severe post - partum fluxus . she was again transferred to the hospital with the following symptoms : cold clammy skin , tachycardia , severe lochia and persistent exanthema or purpura , but without signs of an acute abdomen . during the night of february 11 autopsy revealed a small intracerebral haematoma , normal lungs without pulmonary oedema , ascites and an anaemic , foul smelling uterus filled with purulent and decayed tissue and pus . blood was also obtained directly from the heart during autopsy and lactic acid was found . in this case we could think of a haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage due to clotting disorders possibly resulting from either acute fatty liver of pregnancy hellp syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic microangiopathy ( ttp hus ) or dic . in the conclusions of his 1843 book , scherer attached high importance to the fact that he found lactic acid in cases of puerperal fever , which he had not found before in healthy persons . he held the opinion that lactic acid was formed in blood during bodily deterioration in severe diseases like puerperal fever . lactic acid was thus described for the first time in human blood and was demonstrated for the first time as a symptom of septic and haemorrhagic shock . in the same period a junior obstetrician in vienna , ignaz philipp semmelweis ( 18181865 ) , discovered in 1847 that physicians carried infectious particles on their hands from the mortuary to the obstetrical clinic , causing puerperal fever and puerperal sepsis , and he introduced a successful method for its prevention . louis pasteur ( 18221894 ) found in 1879 that infection with streptococci was the most important cause of puerperal fever . scherer worked closely with the famous pathologist rudolf virchow ( 18211902 ) on several projects ( fig . 2 ) . in 1851 virchow performed an autopsy on a patient who had died from leukaemia and offered scherer blood from this patient for analysis . the results of this analysis were published the same year in the verhandlungen der physikalisch - medicinischen gesellschaft in wrzburg . virchow and scherer had previously studied the spleens of patients who died from leukaemia , and were curious if they could find the same results in the blood . scherer reached the conclusion that : the blood of this patient contains : ameisensure , essigsure und milchsure , die gleichfalls von mir schon frher als in der milzflssigkeit vorkommend bezeichnet wurden ( formic acid , acetic acid , and lactic acid , as also found by me previously in fluids from the spleen ) . 2johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 scherer  is observations inspired others to conduct further research , primarily in patients with leukaemia 1922 , but also in patients with other conditions and diseases and in animal experiments with dogs and rabbits . while scherer found lactic acid in blood obtained after death during autopsy , mosler and krner mention an observation made by carl folwarczny , published in the allgemeinen wiener medicinischen zeitung in 1858 , where blood was withdrawn from a leukaemia patient during life , analysed according to scherer  is method , and found positive for lactic acid . in addition , carl folwarczny described in 1863 in his ' handbuch der physiologischen chemie ' that lactic acid can be found in the blood of patients with leukaemia , septicaemia ( pyaemia ) and in conditions leading to septicaemia like puerperal fever , the latter probably after scherer  is observations . in an extensive article , the berliner physician georg salomon , who had serious doubts that the occurrence of lactic acid in blood was mostly related to leukaemia , proved in 1878 that lactic acid was also present in the blood of patients who were suffering and died from other diseases . he studied blood obtained during autopsy from cadavers , but also blood from patients obtained by bloodletting or cupping , and in some cases he compared the blood before and after death . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in the blood of patients suffering from leukaemia , ( pernicious ) anaemia , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pleuritis , pericarditis , pneumonia and several solid malignant tumours . gaglio is often erroneously mentioned as the first author to find lactic acid in blood 2729 . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in fresh arterial blood withdrawn from dogs and rabbits after bloodletting . both gaglio and berlinerblau , however , neglected previous research , as indignantly described by salomon in 1888 ich erlaube mir , den inhalt meiner arbeiten , die von gaglio nur ganz flchtig , von berlinerblau gar nicht berhrt sind , in krze zu reproduciren ( i take the liberty of summarizing the contents of my work , which was mentioned only briefly by gaglio and not at all by berlinerblau ) . the japanese chemist trasaburo araki showed that the amount of lactic acid in exhausted muscle results from muscle activation . irisawa , inspired by the results obtained by salomon and gaglio , obtained fresh blood of 11 dying patients with serious conditions . in six cases he found hyperlactataemia , in four cases normal values . he speculated on the aetiology of hyperlactataemia , the most plausible cause being the severe hypoxia during the dying process . in an experiment in which he made a dog anaemic for several days , he found a rise in lactic acid levels during the time leading up to death . in cambridge ( uk ) , walter morley fletcher ( 18731933 ) and frederick gowland hopkins ( 18611947 ) worked together on the metabolic changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis under anaerobic conditions , and found that lactate was the product of carbohydrate metabolism . their classic 1907 paper demonstrated rigorously that muscle contraction is accompanied by the anaerobic formation of lactic acid , which is removed aerobically , at a rate depending on the level of exposure to oxygen . poul astrup and john severingshaus mentioned scherer  is 1851 article as first demonstration of lactic acid in blood , but overlooked the 1843 cases and folwarczny  is work . in conclusion , scherer  is 1843 case reports should be cited as the first description of lactic acid in human blood and also as the first demonstration of lactic acid as a pathological finding in septic and haemorrhagic shock . folwarczny , in 1858 , was the first to demonstrate lactic acid in

determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superficial palpation . early complications of pdt include loss of airway , bleeding , conversion to open tracheostomy and death , with later complications including tracheostomy occlusion , tracheal stenosis and granulation . a retrospective study comparing early and late complications of pdt , with or without fob assistance , using the ciaglia blue rhino kit in 243 patients found no between group differences in early and late complications , but one patient experienced cardiac arrest during the use of a fob due to loss of airway . in this study , only 3 patients experienced bleeding after pdt , with all 3 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and having an abnormal coagulation status . however , we were unable to assess long - term complications in patients who were transferred to other facilities . precise positioning is critical when performing pdt , thus requiring use of a fob or direct palpation of the trachea . the biggest disadvantage of our modified percutaneous method was the inability to confirm the pdt site . in five patients , where the underlying structures could not be adequately palpated another disadvantage is the lack of precise endotracheal tube repositioning , which can be achieved with a laryngoscope . although a fob was used to determine the proper tube depth in 55 patients , the needle and guidewire entered the murphy eye of the tube twice . pdt was successfully performed by retracting the tube an additional 12 cm in both cases . although none of these patients experienced endotracheal cuff failure due to needle puncture , accidental cuff puncture may occur . moreover , in contrast to subcutaneous dissection , physicians using our modified technique may be unable to identify vessels between the skin and trachea . ultrasonography , which was used when anatomical structures were not readily identifiable , also has the advantage of screening such blood vessels . since all pdts were performed at a single center by two physicians , and the proper endotracheal tube depth was evaluated in a korean population , it may be difficult to generalize the safety of our simplified technique . another limitation was the absence of patients in which pdt is believed to be difficult , such as patients with severe obesity . although studies have suggested that pdt is safe in obese patients , use of additional equipment , such as a fob or ultrasonograph , has been recommended . we have not performed pdt in morbidly obese patients who may also require extra - long tracheostomy tubes . currently , therefore , a fob should be used when performing pdt in difficult situations , such as in patients with morbid obesity , anatomic alterations or neck stiffness . in conclusion , our results show that pdt with the ciaglia blue rhino technique can be safely performed without a bronchoscope and blunt dissection . this simplified technique is a relatively safe procedure that can be especially useful in situations of limited equipment and medical personnel .

term ( 7 days ) follow - up in 150 patients showed no late complications and no deaths related to pdt . although use of a fob during pdt has been recommended for precise positioning and to avoid complications , bronchoscopy itself can cause complications . also , an additional physician is required and additional costs may result from damage to the fob . thus , several studies have assessed the safety of pdt without a fob , including technical modifications and simplified procedures . direct visualization of the larynx with a laryngoscope confirmed adequate endotracheal tube repositioning depth prior to pdt , while direct or indirect palpation of the trachea confirmed the proper tracheostomy site . although these simplified techniques have been shown to be safe , they have not been widely adopted . this study assessed the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the ciaglia blue rhino , by repositioning the existing endotracheal tube at a pre - determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superficial palpation . early complications of pdt include loss of airway , bleeding , conversion to open tracheostomy and death , with later complications including tracheostomy occlusion , tracheal stenosis and granulation . a retrospective study comparing early and late complications of pdt , with or without fob assistance , using the ciaglia blue rhino kit in 243 patients found no between group differences in early and late complications , but one patient experienced cardiac arrest during the use of a fob due to loss of airway . in this study , only 3 patients experienced bleeding after pdt , with all 3 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and having an abnormal coagulation status . however , we were unable to assess long - term complications in patients who were transferred to other facilities . precise positioning is critical when performing pdt , thus requiring use of a fob or direct palpation of the trachea . the biggest disadvantage of our modified percutaneous method was the inability to confirm the pdt site . in five patients , where the underlying structures could not be adequately palpated another disadvantage is the lack of precise endotracheal tube repositioning , which can be achieved with a laryngoscope . although a fob was used to determine the proper tube depth in 55 patients , the needle and guidewire entered the murphy eye of the tube twice . pdt was successfully performed by retracting the tube an additional 12 cm in both cases . although none of these patients experienced endotracheal cuff failure due to needle puncture , accidental cuff puncture may occur . moreover , in contrast to subcutaneous dissection , physicians using our modified technique may be unable to identify vessels between the skin and trachea . ultrasonography , which was used when anatomical structures were not readily identifiable , also has the advantage of screening such blood vessels . since all pdts were performed at a single center by two physicians , and the proper endotracheal tube depth was evaluated in a korean population , it may be difficult to generalize the safety of our simplified technique . another limitation was the absence of patients in which pdt is believed to be difficult , such as patients with severe obesity . although studies have suggested that pdt is safe in obese patients , use of additional equipment , such as a fob or ultrasonograph , has been recommended . we have not performed pdt in morbidly obese patients who may also require extra - long tracheostomy tubes . currently , therefore , a fob should be used when performing pdt in difficult situations , such as in patients with morbid obesity , anatomic alterations or neck stiffness . in conclusion , our results show that pdt with the ciaglia blue rhino technique can be safely performed without a bronchoscope and blunt dissection . this simplified technique is a relatively safe procedure that can be especially useful in situations of limited equipment and medical personnel .', 'summary': 'when first introduced , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) was performed using a bronchoscope . the bronchoscope itself , however , has several disadvantages , including interruption of ventilation . modifications of the standard pdt technique have suggested that pdt can be safely performed without a bronchoscope . however , the safety of these modifications is unclear and many modifications have yet to be widely adopted . this study retrospectively evaluated the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the cook ciaglia blue rhino in 186 patients . after confirming the underlying structures by palpation , pdt was performed without a bronchoscope or blunt dissection , 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane . ultrasonography was used only when palpation was difficult . except for bleeding in three patients with coagulopathy , none of the patients experienced any early or late complications , and there were no deaths related to pdt . these findings confirm that pdt can be safely performed using a simplified technique , which may be useful in situations with limited equipment and medical personnel .

resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) is one of major pathogens in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media ( csom ) . in addition to intrinsic mrsa infection of the mastoid air cell system , nasal colonization of mrsa , a known predictor of postoperative surgical site infection , may pose increased risk of postoperative complications . the purpose of this study is to describe microbiology of preoperative nasal swab screening and localized middle ear specimens in patients undergoing otologic surgeries. subjects and methodsforty - nine consecutive patients with csom who underwent middle ear surgery were included . preoperative nasal swabs for mrsa , and preoperative and intraoperative middle ear swabs were collected and compared for pathogens. resultspreoperative nasal swab screening confirmed mrsa colonization in 349 patients ( 6.1 ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 949 patients ( 18.4 ) . correlation with preoperative culture results and nasal swab screening results were compatible in 24 patients with positive nasal swab for mrsa and 19 patients with positive nasal swab for mrcns . postoperative conversion to mrsa was observed in 3 patients. conclusionsthe rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community . preoperative mrsa colonization was associated with mrsa from middle ear specimens . further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries .

69 years . according to ethnicity in malaysia , women of indian ethnic group have the highest incidence for cervical cancer followed by chinese and malay ( 3 ) . majority malays are muslims , thus lower incidence of this cancer was observed . in iran , there are almost no extramarital sexual relations and they depend strongly on family - based traditions ( 7 ) the five - year survival exceeded 70 in korea ( 810 ) , 55 in turkey ( 11 ) and it can be as low as 17 which was in uganda ( 12 ) . there were various prognostic factors established in many studies such as stage , age , lymph node involvement and tumor size ( 1316 ) . in kentucky , between january 2001 and may 2010 , a study of 381 cervical cancer patients who were referred to tertiary care centre found that stage of disease was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival ( 17 ) . meanwhile , a study of 44,182 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1993 and 2002 in korea , found that both stage and histological type of cervical cancer were important factors for survival ( 18 ) . to our knowledge , the analysis from published studies was often limited to the frequently used cox proportional hazard regression model when examining the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates ( 17 , 1921 ) . this is perhaps due to the fact that although baseline hazard is not specified in cox model , the parameter can still be estimated . the objective of this study was to determine the effects of explanatory variables on the survival of cervical cancer patients using parametric regression model . in some cases , parametric models are more informative than the cox model such as the baseline hazard and survival estimates are known ( can be estimated ) . several examples of parametric models can be found in the following studies ( 2227 ) . zhu et al . have compared the cox and weibull model in modeling the gastric cancer data and found that the weibull model gave more a precise results in than the cox model ( 28 ) . the weibull model has gained popularity in modeling survival data due to its flexibility in the shape parameter that can accommodate a decreasing , constant and increasing hazard . furthermore , the suitability of the weibull model can be easily assessed using a log - cumulative hazard plot . in this study , a stratified weibull model was used since there was a time - dependent covariate that caused the proportional hazard assumption vio - lated . the study design was retrospective in nature in which patients records were reviewed retrospectively to obtain the data . the husm , located in kubang kerian , kelantan has been long regarded as the referral centre for the east coast region of malaysia . the inclusion criteria were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed with cancer of cervix between 1 july 1995 and 30 june 2007 , and received at least one treatment related to cervical cancer in husm . patients who were died due to other competing causes of death ( not cervical cancer ) , or with incomplete data were excluded from this study . ethical clearance was obtained from research and ethics committee of university sains malaysia ( reference number : usmkk ppp jepem 205.4 ( 2.4 ) ) . the variable of interest was time ( in months ) which was measured from the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer up to the time of death . factors that were considered in the analysis were ethnicity ( non malay , malay ) , lymph node involvement ( negative , positive ) , metastasis ( with metastasis , without metastasis ) , histology ( squamous cell carcinoma , adeno cell carcinoma ) , primary treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy andor chemotherapy ) , age at diagnosis ( 40 , 40 59 , 60 ) and stage ( stage i ii , stage iii iv ) . international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ( figo ) system was used in staging patients with cervical cancer . data analysis was performed using the statistical package tibco spotfire s - plus version 8.1 . the suitability of the weibull model for the data was assessed using a plot of the log of the negative log of the estimated survivor function against log time or log - cumulative hazard plot . univariate analysis was conducted using the simple weibull regression analysis to identify the possible prognostic factors individually . significant factors from the univariate analysis were further analyzed by the weibull multivariate analysis to model the prognostic factors . model selection procedure was based on the forward variable selection method with statistical significance set at 0.10 . the proportionality of the hazards was assessed using the test based on schoenfeld ( 29 ) . as the proportional hazard assumption was not satisfied , a stratified model was used instead ( 30 ) and in measuring the goodness of fit of the model , deviance residuals were used . 1 shows a study flow diagram which summarizes the steps of the statistical analysis performed . the study flow diagram the log -

Summary: ', 'document': 'cervical cancer is the third most common cancer after breast and colorectal cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among women in malaysia(1 - 3 ) . it remains to be one of the major cancers that burden worldwide particularly in under - developed and developing countries ( cervical cancer incidence rate increased with age after 30 years and has its peak at ages 65 - 69 years . according to ethnicity in malaysia , women of indian ethnic group have the highest incidence for cervical cancer followed by chinese and malay ( 3 ) . majority malays are muslims , thus lower incidence of this cancer was observed . in iran , there are almost no extramarital sexual relations and they depend strongly on family - based traditions ( 7 ) the five - year survival exceeded 70 in korea ( 810 ) , 55 in turkey ( 11 ) and it can be as low as 17 which was in uganda ( 12 ) . there were various prognostic factors established in many studies such as stage , age , lymph node involvement and tumor size ( 1316 ) . in kentucky , between january 2001 and may 2010 , a study of 381 cervical cancer patients who were referred to tertiary care centre found that stage of disease was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival ( 17 ) . meanwhile , a study of 44,182 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1993 and 2002 in korea , found that both stage and histological type of cervical cancer were important factors for survival ( 18 ) . to our knowledge , the analysis from published studies was often limited to the frequently used cox proportional hazard regression model when examining the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates ( 17 , 1921 ) . this is perhaps due to the fact that although baseline hazard is not specified in cox model , the parameter can still be estimated . the objective of this study was to determine the effects of explanatory variables on the survival of cervical cancer patients using parametric regression model . in some cases , parametric models are more informative than the cox model such as the baseline hazard and survival estimates are known ( can be estimated ) . several examples of parametric models can be found in the following studies ( 2227 ) . zhu et al . have compared the cox and weibull model in modeling the gastric cancer data and found that the weibull model gave more a precise results in than the cox model ( 28 ) . the weibull model has gained popularity in modeling survival data due to its flexibility in the shape parameter that can accommodate a decreasing , constant and increasing hazard . furthermore , the suitability of the weibull model can be easily assessed using a log - cumulative hazard plot . in this study , a stratified weibull model was used since there was a time - dependent covariate that caused the proportional hazard assumption vio - lated . the study design was retrospective in nature in which patients records were reviewed retrospectively to obtain the data . the husm , located in kubang kerian , kelantan has been long regarded as the referral centre for the east coast region of malaysia . the inclusion criteria were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed with cancer of cervix between 1 july 1995 and 30 june 2007 , and received at least one treatment related to cervical cancer in husm . patients who were died due to other competing causes of death ( not cervical cancer ) , or with incomplete data were excluded from this study . ethical clearance was obtained from research and ethics committee of university sains malaysia ( reference number : usmkk ppp jepem 205.4 ( 2.4 ) ) . the variable of interest was time ( in months ) which was measured from the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer up to the time of death . factors that were considered in the analysis were ethnicity ( non malay , malay ) , lymph node involvement ( negative , positive ) , metastasis ( with metastasis , without metastasis ) , histology ( squamous cell carcinoma , adeno cell carcinoma ) , primary treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy andor chemotherapy ) , age at diagnosis ( 40 , 40 59 , 60 ) and stage ( stage i ii , stage iii iv ) . international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ( figo ) system was used in staging patients with cervical cancer . data analysis was performed using the statistical package tibco spotfire s - plus version 8.1 . the suitability of the weibull model for the data was assessed using a plot of the log of the negative log of the estimated survivor function against log time or log - cumulative hazard plot . univariate analysis was conducted using the simple weibull regression analysis to identify the possible prognostic factors individually . significant factors from the univariate analysis were further analyzed by the weibull multivariate analysis to model the prognostic factors . model selection procedure was based on the forward variable selection method with statistical significance set at 0.10 . the proportionality of the hazards was assessed using the test based on schoenfeld ( 29 ) . as the proportional hazard assumption was not satisfied , a stratified model was used instead ( 30 ) and in measuring the goodness of fit of the model , deviance residuals were used . 1 shows a study flow diagram which summarizes the steps of the statistical analysis performed . the study flow diagram the log -

operatively because the manifestations are similar to appendicitis . laparoscopic appendectomy is widely used for the treatment of appendicitis , but laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucoceles is not routine . we recently managed two large appendiceal mucoceles by laparoscopic resection and report our technique herein . a 44-year - old woman sought evaluation from a gynecologist for a palpable right lower quadrant mass . the abdominal mass was found incidentally while bathing 2 months ago , and has persisted . the blood chemistries and other laboratory findings were normal . a computed tomography ( ct ) scan and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a 14 5 4.5 cm cystic mass arising from the cecum ( fig . the patient was referred to the department of general surgery , where we discussed the surgical options and recommended a laparoscopic resection . an 81-year -

operative diagnosis of an appendiceal mucocele is difficult due to the non - specific nature of the findings . the classic clinical features of an obstructive appendiceal mucocele includes right lower quadrant discomfort , a palpable mass , and x - ray findings of a filling defect in the cecum with non - visualization of the appendix . on ct and ultrasonography , a nodular , enhancing lesion in the wall of the mucocele is suggestive of malignant disease . sometimes , it is asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at surgery or during imaging evaluation for another disease . if a mucocele is found , therapy is surgical . the appropriate type of surgical treatment is related to the dimensions and the histology of the mucocele . an appendectomy is used for simple mucoceles or cystadenomas when the appendiceal base is intact . cecal resection is indicated for cystadenomas with a large base , and a right hemicolectomy is recommended for cystadenocarcinomas . the 10-year survival of patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinomas is 65 among patients treated by hemicolectomy , but only 37 among patients treated by appendectomy alone . while several cases of laparoscopic treatment of appendiceal mucoceles have been reported 4 - 8 , many authors suggest that the laparoscopic approach should be avoided because of the increased risk of rupture and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . pseudomyxoma peritonei is caused by spillage and implantation of mucin - secreting cells into the peritoneal cavity . thus , we reasoned that the complication rate of pseudomyxoma peritonei during laparoscopic surgery would be the same as that of open surgery if a minimal -

known safety and easy accessibility . the authors are also aware of the possibility of rupture during laparoscopic dissection , and the subsequent fatal complication of pseudomyxoma peritonei . nevertheless , if we can handle the tissue with minimal manipulation , and can secure enough safety by using various laparoscopic instruments , laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele might be an alternative surgical option to open surgery .', 'summary': 'laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucoceles has recently been described , but the safety and efficacy are controversial . we present two cases of laparoscopic mucocelectomies involving 14 and 15 cm cystic masses originating from the appendix . the laparoscopic mucocelectomies were performed using four ports . from the beginning of the procedure , a laparoscopic bag was used to safely contain the mucocele , prevent rupture of the mucocele , and retract the mucocele . an endoscopic stapling device was used to transect the base of the cecum . minimal handling was achieved by gravity and with the use of laparoscopic instruments . laparoscopic appendectomies are widely performed for acute appendicitis , but laparoscopic resection is not routinely performed for an appendiceal mucocele because of the risk of perforation and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . we report two cases of laparoscopic appendiceal mucocelectomies , which were performed safely with laparoscopic instruments and minimal manipulation .

october for either year . low numbers of c. punctatus were collected from may - september , with a sharp increases in numbers observed primarily at the beef farm at tongilchon during october for both 2011 and 2012 . this is the first report for collections of culicoides using mosquito magnet traps that use only heat and co2 as attractants . the addition of other chemical attractants , e. g. octenol , has been shown to repel some species of culicine mosquitoes , while enhancing the collection of others , but the relative attractiveness of this attractant has not been investigated for most species of culicoides . a major difference between mosquito magnet and light traps is that mosquito magnet traps operate continuously without bias toward nocturnal and diurnal active species . this difference , however , indicates that comparative analysis between data obtained from mosquito magnet and light traps should be viewed with caution . biting midges are both nuisance biters and vectors of medical and veterinary important pathogens that impact the economy of the animal industry in the rok . c. nipponensis , and c. punctatus were the most commonly collected species by mosquito magnets during this study and have been associated with the transmission of important livestock pathogens , e. g. fukuoka , aino , and ibaraki viruses , or as biting pests of humans ( c. erairai ) . consequently , surveillance of these and other species of culicoides and associated pathogens are an important part of the veterinary health service to identify relative vector populations , their distributions throughout the rok , and the presence and prevalence of pathogens affecting livestock and poultry . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus in the mosquito magnet collections is similar to findings by cho and chong and kang and yu using new jersey light traps . similarly , lee found that c. punctatus , c. arakawae , and c. tainanus kieffer were the most commonly collected species at inland sites , whereas c. nipponensis and c. sinanoensis tokunaga were the predominant species collected from the south and eastern coastal areas in the rok . recently kim et al . found that c. punctatus and c. arakawae were the dominant species collected from light traps set in 9 cowsheds in the southern part of the rok . the unprecedented predominance of c. erairai and relatively low numbers of c. arakawae in the mosquito magnet traps compared to these and other previous reports may reflect the relative attraction of these species to light and the attractants associated with the mosquito magnet traps . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus at a cowshed at tongilchon agrees with the host preference of these species for cattle . although c. arakawae appears to have a preference for feeding on birds , it also readily feeds on cattle , which would explain its abundance around cowsheds in other reports but not the low numbers collected at the cowshed at tongilchon in this survey . the variable distribution of culicoides spp . over a limited area ( 2 km radius ) demonstrates the focal species abundance due to little understood environmental and host attraction factors . for example , high numbers of c. erairai were observed at the nnsc camp where humans are believed to be the primary host , while c. nipponensis was the primary species collected at daeseongdong and tongilchon where a variety of hosts ( e. g. cattle , dogs , large water birds , and humans ) serve as potential hosts . thus , further studies comparing light and mosquito magnet traps and range of available hosts may reveal differential attraction for different species and assist in surveys targeting particular species . additionally , studies on the geographical and seasonal distributions , host attraction ( e. g. placement of traps near human habitation and poultry , cattle , and swine farms ) , temporal biting activity , pathogen infection rates , and their role as potential vectors of zoonotic pathogens that impact on human and animal health are warranted . although limited , the data presented herein provide a better understanding of the biology , ecology , and environmental parameters that affect relative population abundance of culicoides spp . that can be used to predict potential human and animal health risks and develop and implement mitigation strategies .

            "Culicoides spp. are small, bloodsucking insects known as biting midges that can cause significant impact on human and veterinary health as vectors of various viruses and parasites. Research on these insects in the Republic of Korea has found 16 species, with Culicoides nipponensis and Culicoides punctatus being the most commonly collected. These biting midges are important to monitor for their role in transmitting pathogens affecting livestock and poultry, and their varied distribution and host preferences may influence surveillance and control strategies.</s>\n",

this is a tumor suppressor protein , an important gatekeeper and effector of the cell cycle . mutations of the p53 gene in all forms of porokeratosis , also in dsap , create a permissive state of uncoordinated cell cycling , and predispose cells to death . in our case , the lack of systemic involvement led to our hypothesis of a secondary dermal deposition of amyloid proteins and the existence of a close relationship between these two processes . this hypothesis was confirmed by positive staining with congo red and immunohistochemical staining with the anticytokeratin moabs strongly positive for ck5 , just below the epidermal porokeratotic zone in close proximity to the cornoid lamella . this cytokeratin is , in fact , strongly represented in the basal cell layer and these results indicate that the dermal deposits were amyloid originating from the epidermis ( type ii keratin ) . nowadays , more studies are necessary to clarify the exact mechanism that leads to secondary deposition of dermal amyloid in porokeratotic disease and the frequency of this association . we also suggest utilization of moabs for ck5 as a first - line target in these conditions , encouraged by the immediate and strong positivity of this protein in immunohistochemical studies , whereas pan - cytokeratin at first produced negative results .

            "Porokeratoses are skin conditions with unknown causes, marked by abnormal keratinization in the epidermis and the presence of coronoid lamella, a column of parakeratotic cells in the stratum corneum. Disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) is a form of porokeratosis characterized by small, erythematous, squamo-papular lesions with an atrophic center and keratotic borders. Only 7 cases of DSP's association with amyloid substance have been reported; this paper presents an eighth case and an atypical immunohistochemical method to identify the amyloid substance. The patient, a 76-year-old woman, had a 20-year history of skin lesions on her extremities, which had worsened over time and were exacerbated during the summer. The skin biopsy revealed atrophy of the epidermis, hyperorthokeratosis, and the presence of cornoid lamella. A compact deposit of eosinophilic material suspected to be amyloid was found in the papillary dermis. Two immunohistochemical stainings using specific moabs to pan-cytokeratin ae1-ae3 and ck5 were performed, revealing a difference in staining results. The acellular deposits were negative for ckae1-ae3, but strongly positive for ck5, indicating a specific origin of the amyloid substance from the basal cell layer of the epidermis. The mechanism behind DSP inducing dermal amyloid deposits is unclear, but the lack of systemic involvement in this case suggests a secondary dermal deposition of amyloid proteins and a close relationship between the two processes. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanism of dermal amyloid deposition in porokeratotic diseases and the frequency of this association.</s>\n",

reymond ( 18181896 ) published several articles on the influence of lactic acid on muscle contraction 59 . araki and zillessen found that if they interrupted oxygen supply to muscles in mammals and birds , lactic acid was formed and increased 1014 . this was the first demonstration of the relationship between tissue hypoxia and the formation of lactate . the occurrence of increased lactic acid in blood ( hyperlactataemia ) nowadays reflects severe illness , in which the increased blood lactate levels may result from both anaerobic and aerobic production or from a decreased clearance . it was the german physician chemist johann joseph scherer who first demonstrated the occurrence of lactic acid in human blood under pathological conditions after death in 1843 and 1851 15 , 17 , and carl folwarczny in 1858 who first demonstrated lactic acid in blood of a living patient . in this article we wish to honour scherer  is forgotten observations and describe the influence of his finding on further research on lactic acid at the end of the 19th century . born on 18 march 1814 in aschaffenburg , germany , scherer studied medicine , chemistry , geology and mineralogy at the university of wrzburg between 1833 and 1836 . he obtained his phd in medicine and surgery in 1838 with a thesis entitled versuche ber die wirkung einiger gifte auf verscheidene thierclassen he practised medicine in wipfeld , but inspired by the chemist ernst von bibra ( 18061878 ) he completed his studies in chemistry at the university of munich between 18381840 . in 1840 he was employed at the laboratory of justus liebig at giessen , and became professor at the medical faculty in 1842 , professor of organic chemistry in 1847 , and later professor of general , anorganic and pharmaceutical chemistry . his work especially concerned quantitative research on blood and urine in pathological conditions . in 1843 he published his book chemische und mikroskopische untersuchungen zur pathologie angestellt an den kliniken des julius - hospitales zu wrzburg ( chemical and microscopic investigations of pathology carried out at the julius clinic at wrzburg ) ( fig . 1 ) , in which he described 72 case reports , giving details on clinical course , diagnosis , and results obtained during autopsy and analysis of body fluids . in one chapter in his 1843 book entitled ' untersuchungen von krankhaften stoffen bei der i m winter 18421843 in wrzburg und der umgegend herrschenden puerperal - fieber - epidemie ' ( investigations of pathological substances obtained during the epidemic of puerperal fever which occurred in the winter of 18421843 in and around wrzburg ) scherer described the cases of seven young women who all died peripartum . one of the women , the 23-year - old primipara eva rumpel , gave birth to a healthy child on 9 january 1843 . the same night she developed a painfully swollen abdomen and became ill , feverish , and sweaty , with rapid pulse and severe thirst . the next evening she deteriorated , became delirious , with anxious breathing , a tense abdomen , cold extremities and rapid pulse , finally losing consciousness . a. m. 36 h after the onset of the first symptoms , she died . during autopsy , severe purulent endometritis , vaginal pus , pulmonary oedema , and shock liver and shock spleen were found . the blood that was obtained directly from the heart was chemically analysed , in which lactic acid was found . most likely this unfortunate woman had died from a fulminant septic shock caused by group a haemolytic streptococci ( streptococcus pyogenes ) . another patient , the 28-year - old , 7 months pregnant ( second pregnancy ) margaretha glck , was , after being icteric , nauseous , vomiting and complaining about epigastric pain for 8 days , admitted to the lying - in birth clinic on 6 february 1843 . four days later she was transferred to the hospital with severe nosebleeds and generalised exanthema or purpura . in the evening she suffered from severe gastric bleeding and epistaxis , showing rapid pulse , cold extremities and dizziness . the next morning , she was transferred back to the birth clinic , where she gave birth to a premature child ( 30 weeks ) and suffered from a severe post - partum fluxus . she was again transferred to the hospital with the following symptoms : cold clammy skin , tachycardia , severe lochia and persistent exanthema or purpura , but without signs of an acute abdomen . during the night of february 11 autopsy revealed a small intracerebral haematoma , normal lungs without pulmonary oedema , ascites and an anaemic , foul smelling uterus filled with purulent and decayed tissue and pus . blood was also obtained directly from the heart during autopsy and lactic acid was found . in this case we could think of a haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage due to clotting disorders possibly resulting from either acute fatty liver of pregnancy hellp syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic microangiopathy ( ttp hus ) or dic . in the conclusions of his 1843 book , scherer attached high importance to the fact that he found lactic acid in cases of puerperal fever , which he had not found before in healthy persons . he held the opinion that lactic acid was formed in blood during bodily deterioration in severe diseases like puerperal fever . lactic acid was thus described for the first time in human blood and was demonstrated for the first time as a symptom of septic and haemorrhagic shock . in the same period a junior obstetrician in vienna , ignaz philipp semmelweis ( 18181865 ) , discovered in 1847 that physicians carried infectious particles on their hands from the mortuary to the obstetrical clinic , causing puerperal fever and puerperal sepsis , and he introduced a successful method for its prevention . louis pasteur ( 18221894 ) found in 1879 that infection with streptococci was the most important cause of puerperal fever . scherer worked closely with the famous pathologist rudolf virchow ( 18211902 ) on several projects ( fig . 2 ) . in 1851 virchow performed an autopsy on a patient who had died from leukaemia and offered scherer blood from this patient for analysis . the results of this analysis were published the same year in the verhandlungen der physikalisch - medicinischen gesellschaft in wrzburg . virchow and scherer had previously studied the spleens of patients who died from leukaemia , and were curious if they could find the same results in the blood . scherer reached the conclusion that : the blood of this patient contains : ameisensure , essigsure und milchsure , die gleichfalls von mir schon frher als in der milzflssigkeit vorkommend bezeichnet wurden ( formic acid , acetic acid , and lactic acid , as also found by me previously in fluids from the spleen ) . 2johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 scherer  is observations inspired others to conduct further research , primarily in patients with leukaemia 1922 , but also in patients with other conditions and diseases and in animal experiments with dogs and rabbits . while scherer found lactic acid in blood obtained after death during autopsy , mosler and krner mention an observation made by carl folwarczny , published in the allgemeinen wiener medicinischen zeitung in 1858 , where blood was withdrawn from a leukaemia patient during life , analysed according to scherer  is method , and found positive for lactic acid . in addition , carl folwarczny described in 1863 in his ' handbuch der physiologischen chemie ' that lactic acid can be found in the blood of patients with leukaemia , septicaemia ( pyaemia ) and in conditions leading to septicaemia like puerperal fever , the latter probably after scherer  is observations . in an extensive article , the berliner physician georg salomon , who had serious doubts that the occurrence of lactic acid in blood was mostly related to leukaemia , proved in 1878 that lactic acid was also present in the blood of patients who were suffering and died from other diseases . he studied blood obtained during autopsy from cadavers , but also blood from patients obtained by bloodletting or cupping , and in some cases he compared the blood before and after death . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in the blood of patients suffering from leukaemia , ( pernicious ) anaemia , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pleuritis , pericarditis , pneumonia and several solid malignant tumours . gaglio is often erroneously mentioned as the first author to find lactic acid in blood 2729 . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in fresh arterial blood withdrawn from dogs and rabbits after bloodletting . both gaglio and berlinerblau , however , neglected previous research , as indignantly described by salomon in 1888 ich erlaube mir , den inhalt meiner arbeiten , die von gaglio nur ganz flchtig , von berlinerblau gar nicht berhrt sind , in krze zu reproduciren ( i take the liberty of summarizing the contents of my work , which was mentioned only briefly by gaglio and not at all by berlinerblau ) . the japanese chemist trasaburo araki showed that the amount of lactic acid in exhausted muscle results from muscle activation . irisawa , inspired by the results obtained by salomon and gaglio , obtained fresh blood of 11 dying patients with serious conditions . in six cases he found hyperlactataemia , in four cases normal values . he speculated on the aetiology of hyperlactataemia , the most plausible cause being the severe hypoxia during the dying process . in an experiment in which he made a dog anaemic for several days , he found a rise in lactic acid levels during the time leading up to death . in cambridge ( uk ) , walter morley fletcher ( 18731933 ) and frederick gowland hopkins ( 18611947 ) worked together on the metabolic changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis under anaerobic conditions , and found that lactate was the product of carbohydrate metabolism . their classic 1907 paper demonstrated rigorously that muscle contraction is accompanied by the anaerobic formation of lactic acid , which is removed aerobically , at a rate depending on the level of exposure to oxygen . poul astrup and john severingshaus mentioned scherer  is 1851 article as first demonstration of lactic acid in blood , but overlooked the 1843 cases and folwarczny  is work . in conclusion , scherer  is 1843 case reports should be cited as the first description of lactic acid in human blood and also as the first demonstration of lactic acid as a pathological finding in septic and haemorrhagic shock . folwarczny , in 1858 , was the first to demonstrate lactic acid in blood in a living patient .

the number of each experimental group was 6 , except for the assessment of the mean survival time ( 11 animals per group per dose of cyclophosphamide ) . the effect of cyclophosphamide on the metabolism of ammonia was estimated at the background of the increased gastrointestinal luminal ammonia pool . ammonia , glutamine , and urea were assayed in blood obtained from the trunk by decapitation at 0.5 , 1.5 , or 3 h after the administration of aa and ( or ) cyclophosphamide ( 600 mg kg ) . aa was administered immediately before the exposure to cyclophosphamide . in set 2 , the clinical meaning of alterations of the kinetics of gastrointestinal ammonia was elucidated by assessing the impact of gavages with aa upon clinical manifestations of toxic effects and the duration of life observed in rats after the subsequent treatment with cyclophosphamide ( 200 , 600 , 1000 , or 1400 mg kg ) . differences between group mean values of metabolic indices were estimated by the two - way anova ( cyclophosphamide aa ) and the fisher lsd test , that of mean survival time by the mann - whitney u test . the data was analyzed using originpro 8.5 software ( origin lab corporation , northampton , mass , usa ) and presented as mean se . at p in rats , subjected to the sole gavages with ammonium or sodium salts of acetic acid ( 12 mmol kg ) , no visible toxic effects have been noticed within subsequent 48 h. the administration of cyclophosphamide in dose 200 mg kg had no marked effect upon animals ' behavior within 18 h ; 600 mg kg resulted in the development of slowly progressing somnolence and stupor . the administration of cyclophosphamide in dose 1000 or 1400 mg kg resulted in tremor , the loss of righting , and audiomotor reflexes within 3 h ; within 16 h the soporose state was incidentally superposed by tonic seizures . no noticeable symptoms of intoxication were observed within 0.5 h after the administration of cyclophosphamide in any dose but 1400 mg kg . the increase of blood ammonia , glutamine , and urea was observed within 3 h after the administration of cyclophosphamide and ( or ) aa . at the background of their combined dosing , the blood ammonia level increased 2.3 times at 1.5 h , while at the background of the separate application of cyclophosphamide this could be observed 1.5 h later . at 1.5 h after the combined toxicants ' administration , the ammonia blood level has been 1.6 times higher , compared with the separate application of cyclophosphamide . when combined , aa and cyclophosphamide increased blood levels of ammonia , glutamine ( at 1.5 h ) , and urea ( at 3.0 h ) more markedly than that when separately applied ( figure 1 ) . the pretreatment with nonlethal dose of aa enhanced the lethal action of cyclophosphamide : the mean survival time of rats , which obtained cyclophosphamide in doses 200 , 600 , 1000 , or 1400 mg kg , decreased 1.5 , 2.1 , 2.8 , or 6.1 times , respectively ( figure 2 ) . animals , subjected to the combined dosing , manifested symptoms which were characteristic of the effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts , such as exophthalmos , transient excitation , trembling , replaced by opistotonus and apnea , despite the fact that no marked symptoms of intoxication were observed in intact rats which obtained the same dose of aa . the digestive tract is a primary ammonia pool in the human body . though depending on the constitution of the indigenous gut microflora , the luminal ammonia production varies largely among individuals 13 , 14 . on an average , 4 g of ammonia comes from the gut into a portal blood and eventually are absorbed by the liver during a 24-h period . normally , luminal ammonia is absorbed readily by gastric , iliac , and colonic mucosa . the hepatic vein blood ammonia level depends linearly on a portal ammonia level , and the latter on a luminal ammonia concentration . the caval blood ammonia level may have the similar dependence because of the substantial rate of the transperitoneal ammonia translocation . hence , the flux of gastrointestinal ammonia into the common bloodstream and then into the brain may vary depending on the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool . this must be of a special importance at the background of the impairment of the intestinal mucosa barrier function , which is characteristic of the systemic action of both nitrogen and sulfur mustards 3 , 7 , 21 . our study showed that the pronounced hyperammonaemic effect could be seen at 3.0 h after the administration of cyclophosphamide . when the latter was combined with aa , the ammonia level exceeded that in case of the separate application of cyclophosphamide ( figure 1 ) . in intact rat , the luminal ammonia pool of the digestive tract amounts to 1.1 mmol kg ( calculated by the data of ) . this indicates the positive correlation between the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide and the luminal ammonia pool of the digestive tract . in rats , the inhalation of methyl - bis ( -chloroethyl ) amine has been reported to inhibit the liver urea synthesis . hypothetically , the similar effect could contribute to hyperammonaemia observed in this work , though cyclophosphamide increased not only the blood level of ammonia but that of glutamine and urea as well ( figure 1 ) . so , the present data provide no evidence of the failure of glutamine andor urea synthesis as a major contributive cause of observed hyperammonaemia . therefore , the latter may be attributed , mainly , to the impairment of the gastrointestinal barrier function . the enhancement by gavages with aa of the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide promoted its lethal action ; the degree of the promotion correlated positively with the dose of cyclophosphamide ( figure 2 ) . the involvement of ammonia in the lethal effect was clearly indicated by the accentuation of symptoms which were the characteristic effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . the maximal decrease of the mean survival time has been demonstrated at the background of cyclophosphamide - induced severe neurological disorders . accordingly , the maximal detrimental effect of the redistribution of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia should be expected in heavy exposure to mustard gas , bringing to the development of acute neurological disorders . such cases have been observed in iran - iraqi war as well as in bari harbor accident on december 2nd , 1943 , where first deaths occurred 18 h after the exposure . ammonia gas is very aggressive and cytotoxic until it is converted into ammonium ions , which cells can tolerate at millimolar levels . the ensuing restriction of the cellular energy supply may be potentiated by the draining of the cellular nad pool by the alkylating agent - mediated activation of poly - adp - ribosylation in various cells . hence , the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool might be involved in the development of not only acute neurological disorders but also some other systemic effects . this may explain the shortening by gavages with aa of the mean survival time in rats treated with cyclophosphamide in dose which was not apparently neurotoxic ( 200 mg kg ) . therefore , in rat , the size of the luminal ammonia pool of the digestive tract constitutes one of leading factors contributing to the severe toxicity of cyclophosphamide . in rats , the increase of the digestive tract luminal ammonia pool by the mean of an oral gavage with nonlethal dose of ammonium acetate enhanced the hyperammonaemic action of cyclophosphamide while promoting its lethal action . animals , exposed to the combination of toxicants , manifested symptoms which were characteristic of the effect of lethal doses of ammonia salts . these data provide the evidence of the detrimental role of gastrointestinal luminal ammonia in the acute high - dose cyclophosphamide toxicity . so , before addressing the challenge of cyclophosphamide myeloablative therapeutic regimens , it is important to consider the possibility of the promotion of the toxic action of cyclophosphamide by digestive tract luminal ammonia .

            "Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain types of cancer and solid tumors. It can cause neurotoxicity and other side effects. A study in rats showed that the combination of cyclophosphamide and gastrointestinal ammonia salts can increase blood levels of ammonia, glutamine, and urea, and lead to more severe symptoms and shorter survival time. The study suggests that gastrointestinal luminal ammonia may play a role in the toxic action of cyclophosphamide and should be considered when treating patients with this drug.</s>\n",

introducer needle , included in the cook ciaglia blue rhino set , and proper needle position was confirmed by air regurgitation with a syringe containing normal saline . the remaining pdt procedure was performed using the previous standard method with a 7 tracheostomy tube ( twist , tracoe , germany ) . a 8 tube was used only in patients in whom bronchoscopic lavage was planned ( about 10 patients ) . however , all 3 patients were receiving either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and had an abnormal coagulation status . bleeding in all three long - term ( 7 days ) follow - up in 150 patients showed no late complications and no deaths related to pdt . although use of a fob during pdt has been recommended for precise positioning and to avoid complications , bronchoscopy itself can cause complications . also , an additional physician is required and additional costs may result from damage to the fob . thus , several studies have assessed the safety of pdt without a fob , including technical modifications and simplified procedures . direct visualization of the larynx with a laryngoscope confirmed adequate endotracheal tube repositioning depth prior to pdt , while direct or indirect palpation of the trachea confirmed the proper tracheostomy site . although these simplified techniques have been shown to be safe , they have not been widely adopted . this study assessed the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the ciaglia blue rhino , by repositioning the existing endotracheal tube at a pre - determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superficial palpation . early complications of pdt include loss of airway , bleeding , conversion to open tracheostomy and death , with later complications including tracheostomy occlusion , tracheal stenosis and granulation . a retrospective study comparing early and late complications of pdt , with or without fob assistance , using the ciaglia blue rhino kit in 243 patients found no between group differences in early and late complications , but one patient experienced cardiac arrest during the use of a fob due to loss of airway . in this study , only 3 patients experienced bleeding after pdt , with all 3 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and having an abnormal coagulation status . however , we were unable to assess long - term complications in patients who were transferred to other facilities . precise positioning is critical when performing pdt , thus requiring use of a fob or direct palpation of the trachea . the biggest disadvantage of our modified percutaneous method was the inability to confirm the pdt site . in five patients , where the underlying structures could not be adequately palpated another disadvantage is the lack of precise endotracheal tube repositioning , which can be achieved with a laryngoscope . although a fob was used to determine the proper tube depth in 55 patients , the needle and guidewire entered the murphy eye of the tube twice . pdt was successfully performed by retracting the tube an additional 12 cm in both cases . although none of these patients experienced endotracheal cuff failure due to needle puncture , accidental cuff puncture may occur . moreover , in contrast to subcutaneous dissection , physicians using our modified technique may be unable to identify vessels between the skin and trachea . ultrasonography , which was used when anatomical structures were not readily identifiable , also has the advantage of screening such blood vessels . since all pdts were performed at a single center by two physicians , and the proper endotracheal tube depth was evaluated in a korean population , it may be difficult to generalize the safety of our simplified technique . another limitation was the absence of patients in which pdt is believed to be difficult , such as patients with severe obesity . although studies have suggested that pdt is safe in obese patients , use of additional equipment , such as a fob or ultrasonograph , has been recommended . we have not performed pdt in morbidly obese patients who may also require extra - long tracheostomy tubes . currently , therefore , a fob should be used when performing pdt in difficult situations , such as in patients with morbid obesity , anatomic alterations or neck stiffness . in conclusion , our results show that pdt with the ciaglia blue rhino technique can be safely performed without a bronchoscope and blunt dissection . this simplified technique is a relatively safe procedure that can be especially useful in situations of limited equipment and medical personnel .

74 years ) , and the right ear was operated in 34 ears , the left in 32 ears . upon the initial visit in the outpatient department , the external auditory canal was cleaned , and the middle ear discharge was collected with collected with cotton swabs through sterile otoscopes , taking care not to touch the external auditory canal skin . to assess nasal colonization of s. aureus , the nasal samples were obtained by cotton swab from the anterior vestibular of the nares by the physician . during the operation , intraoperative culture specimens were taken in cases with overt discharge in the middle ear cavity . during postoperative period of 1 month , postoperative culture specimens were again taken in cases with otorrhea through the external auditory canal . all culture samples were in stuart transport medium and transported to the laboratory , where the samples were inoculated onto blood agar , macconkey  is agar , and chocolate agar plates . all plates were incubated at 37-c aerobically under 5 ( v v ) co2 and examined 24 and 48 hours later . susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion . identified pathogen species and antimicrobial susceptibility were compared between nasal swab and perioperative ( preoperative , intraoperative and postoperative otorrhea ) cultures . statistical analysis was performed with fisher  is exact testusing spss statistical software ( version 15.0 ; spss inc . among the 67 patients undergoing operation for csom , nasal swab confirmed bacterial colonization in 37 ( 55.2 ) patients ( table 1 ) . clinically importantly , nasal cavity colonization of s. aureus was noted in 1067 ( 14.9 ) of patients , and 467 ( 6.0 ) patients were positive for mrsa . also , methicillin - sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) was identified in 937 ( 23.4 ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 1167 ( 13.4 ) of patients . preoperative ear culture studies identified pathogens in 3967 ( 58.2 ) of the patients : the most commonly identified species was staphylococcus mrcns 26.9 , methicillin - sensitive coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mscns ) 1.5 , mrsa 13.4 and mssa 11.9 . mrsa was found in 340 ( 4.5 ) ears , mssa in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) , mrcns in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) and mscns in 1 ear ( 1.5 ) . after the surgery , 11 of the 67 patients developed otorrhea within 1 month postoperatively . the postoperative culture studies identified mrsa in 311 ( 27.3 ) and acinetobacter species in 111 ( 9.1 ) and fungus in 211 ( 18.1 ) patients ( table 2 ) . preoperative ear culture results and nasal swab culture results showed significant difference ( p0.001 ) , as well as intraoperative middle ear cultures and postoperative otorrhea culture results showed significant difference ( p0.023 ) . however , no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.493 ) . then we compared the culture results according to the presence of bacterial growth and reports of no growth ( fig . no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear culture , and nasal swab culture results ( p0.055 ) , between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.068 ) , or nasal swab and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.094 ) . lastly , the culture results were compared according to the presence of antibiotic resistance ( fig . no significant difference was noted between the antibiotic - susceptible and resistant strains identified between preoperative ear culture and nasal swab cultures ( p0.098 ) , or between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea cultures ( p0.053 ) . then we analyzed the correlation of isolated organisms from the nasal swab and other cultures in patients with nasal colonization of antibiotic - resistant strains ( fig . 4 ) . among 4 patients with identified with nasal mrsa colonization , preoperative ear cultures were also positive for mrsa in 3 patients ( 75.0 ) . however , intraoperative culture identified mrsa in only one patient , and none of the patients developed mrsa infection postoperatively . preoperative ear cultures reported mrsa in 1 , mrcns in 1 , and mscns in 7 , ciprobay - resistant pseudomonas in 1 , and no growth in 2 patients . increasing incidence of antibiotic - resistant bacterial strains in csom patients poses a challenge to not only the selection of appropriate antibiotics therapy , but also to prevent the emergence of resistance to glycopeptides , the main drugs chosen for mrsa . it has been reported that patients who are colonized with s. aureus are the main source of s. aureus in hospitals , and that nasal carriage of mrsa increases the risk of postoperative infection . since the rate of methicillin resistance is higher in korean csom patients compared to other countries , we examined the rate of nasal mrsa colonization . the rate of nasal carriage of mrsa in csom patients was higher than among healthy individuals reported as 0.2 - 2.8 of the united states population.7 ) although this study was limited to small number of patients , the finding may suggest that in addition to nosocomial infection , community - acquired mrsa infection may contribute partially to the relatively higher rate of mrsa in csom patients in korea . on the other hand , the rates of bacterial isolation from preoperative ear discharge , intraoperative middle ear discharge , or postoperative otorrhea cultures in our patients were lower . also , the perioperative culture studies frequently reported no growth of pathogens . given that the patients were prescribed with antibiotics prior to surgery , it may signify that current antibiotics are effective in infection control during the tympanomastoid surgery . furthermore , the interpretation of the culture results from postoperative otorrhea is limited since antibiotics were routinely used postoperatively in all patients and culture samples were taken from the external auditory canal in cases with overt otorrhea or from wet surface of the grafted tympanic membrane immediately after removal of the packing material at 2 weeks postoperatively . the culture results can only reflect that mrsa infection that could not be controlled by routine antibiotics , which may be clinically significant . mrsa has been identified not only in csom patients,2,3,5,13 ) but also in patients with external otitis.14 ) s. aureus has been implicated in biofilm formation complicating cochlear implants.15 - 17 ) nasal mrsa colonization deserves attention since transmission from nasal carriage to surgical site infections or bacteremia is possible , and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality . previous studies have reported that elimination of nasal mrsa colonization reduces the risk of postoperative infections.8,18,19 ) application of 2 mupirocin calcium ointment to the nares has been proven to be effective , and chlorhexidine - based solutions is used to reduce the density of skin colonization of mrsa preoperatively.18 - 20 ) a recent study compared the rates of mrsa infection in otolaryngology surgeries , before and after implementation of preoperative screening and treatment of nasal mrsa carriage.21 ) further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries . the rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community . further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries .

            "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is an inflammatory disease of the middle ear and mastoid air cell system, which can result in irreversible changes in the inner ear. Dysfunction of the eustachian tube and bacterial infection are important factors in the multifactorial pathogenesis of CSOM. Both medical and surgical treatment modalities are important in CSOM. Bacterial pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), staphylococcus, and pseudomonas species, have been identified from the middle ear and mastoid air cells or nasopharynx in CSOM patients. The study aimed to examine the prevalence of nasal MRSA colonization in patients undergoing otologic surgeries and determine the association between MRSA colonization and the pathogens identified from perioperative culture studies. The study found that nasal colonization of MRSA was noted in 6.0% of patients, and 4.5% of ears developed otorrhea within 1 month postoperatively. The findings suggest that in addition to nosocomial infection, community-acquired MRSA infection may contribute partially to the relatively higher rate of MRSA in CSOM patients in Korea.</s>\n",

in1 noted that when the vaginal pressure increased , there was a significant difference in the thickness of the tra . critchley9 observed that there was a more significant difference in the thickness of the tra when contraction of the pfm was made together with the abdominal hollowing motion than when only the abdominal hollowing motion was conducted . these study results show that contraction of the pfm promotes activation of the tra , a deep muscle . however , the pfm is not often used in daily life , and therefore performance of appropriate exercises and precise contraction of the muscle is very difficult . as a measure to resolve such problems for women with urinary incontinence and cystocele , biofeedback using ultrasound is being used to visualize the contraction of the pfm , to provide precise and immediate visual feedback to subjects10 . nevertheless , no research has analyzed the effects of precise pfm contraction on abdominal muscles . therefore , the purpose of this study was to verify whether precise contraction of the pfm using visual feedback actually affects the thickness of the abdominal muscles . the subjects were 29 adults in their 20s who consented to participate in this study . they had no history of neurological or muscle lesions within the previous six months . this study was approved by the ethics committee of the catholic university of pusan . first , the thicknesses of the external oblique muscle ( eo ) , io , and tra were measured with the subjects lying in a supine position at rest . after a 10-minute rest , the subjects were instructed to contract the pfm in an ordinary way during the hollowing motion , and then the thicknesses of their abdominal muscles were measured . in order to exclude a carry - over effect , the thicknesses of the abdominal muscles were measured as the subjects contracted the pfm while watching a visual feedback video the next day . the subjects were instructed to tighten the internal muscles of the pelvis , as if to hold in urine , and slowly pull and raise them internally . however , they were not instructed to induce or prevent the utilization of the abdominal muscles6 . to provide subjects with accurate visual feedback , a convex ultrasound probe was positioned , with the angle between the abdomen and the probe at 10 ( esaote europe b. v . netherland ) , from 5 cm above the symphysis pubis , and visual feedback was given by casting the probe on the perineum . changes in imaging during the contraction of the pfm were explained , and the subjects were taught how to contract the pfm . for the abdominal hollowing motion , a stabilizer ( chattanooga group inc . usa ) was used in order to minimize the contraction of the io and eo and to trigger selective contraction of the tra . ultrasonic diagnostic equipment ( sonoace x4 , korea ) was used to measure the thickness of the abdominal muscles . the thicknesses of the external oblique abdominal , the internal oblique abdominal , and the transversus abdominis muscles were measured at the end point of expiration3 . they were measured in an anteromedial direction using a linear probe ( 7.5 mhz ) at the middle , between the iliac crest and the eleventh rib on the right side of the subjects12 , 13 . one -

rest measurements . this result is similar to that of the present study , in that the thickness of the tra showed a statistically significant increase under both contraction conditions . however , critchely2 noted that because precise contraction of the pfm was difficult when subjects conducted the hollowing motion and contracted the pfm at the same time , there was a possibility that movement of the pfm did not occur or that subjects concentrated more on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles drawing in the lower abdomen than on the contraction of the pfm . this could explain our result , that the thickness of the tra increased less during the precise contraction of the pfm with visual feedback than during the contraction of the pfm without visual feedback . due to the pfm s anatomical location and structure , it is hard to voluntarily conduct precise contraction of the pfm . this may result in the iliacus muscle , the abductor muscle inside the hip joint , and the abdominal muscles , in particular the tra and the io , contracting together , rather than a contraction of the pfm9 , 15 . therefore , we presume that when subjects conduct the hollowing motion without precisely performing the contraction of the pfm , they concentrate on the contraction of the deep abdominal muscles , such as the tra , which affects the thickness of the tra . this study verified that there is an increase in the thickness of the tra during pfm contraction , but that the increase in the thickness of the tra was smaller during the contraction of the pfm with visual feedback . we speculate that this is likely because the precise contraction of the pfm decreases mobilization of the deep muscles reducing the simultaneous contraction rate of the tra . training to strengthen the pfm may be an effective exercise for improving continence . however , if the purpose is to strengthen the tra simply for the stabilization of the lumbopelvic girdle , hollowing with visual feedback is not an efficient exercise method for the pfm .

            "The pelvic floor muscle (PFM) plays a crucial role in supporting the pelvic organs and aiding in bladder and bowel control. It also contributes to stabilizing the lumbopelvic girdle and spine, as well as providing postural adjustment. Recent studies have found that PFM exercises, such as abdominal hollowing training, can help stabilize the lower abdomen and improve trunk stabilization. However, performing appropriate exercises and precise PFM contraction can be challenging. Biofeedback using ultrasound has been used to visualize PFM contraction and provide precise and immediate feedback to subjects, especially for women with urinary incontinence and cystocele. This study aimed to verify whether precise PFM contraction using visual feedback affects the thickness of abdominal muscles, such as the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles. The results showed that there were significant differences in the thickness of the transverse abdominis muscle between the contraction of the PFM and without visual feedback. The study suggests that precise PFM contraction with visual feedback can help reduce the simultaneous contraction rate of deep abdominal muscles, such as the transverse abdominis, making it an efficient exercise method for PFM strengthening.</s>\n",

term macrolides , and frequent recurrences develop unless treated by steroids.13 ecrs is common in asians . to make a diagnosis , the following must be examined : history of respiratory diseases ; imaging tests of the rhinosinuses ; laboratory data related to allergic reactions ; and histopathological tests.3,4 only one case of ecrs has been published that was associated with optic neuropathy , although several cases with optic nerve complications in cases of allergic fungal sinusitis have been reported.5,6 we have examined a case of ecrs with optic neuropathy probably caused by compression or inflammatory invasion of the optic canal by an expansion of the inflamed tissues . even though endoscopic surgery ( ess ) and steroid therapy were performed on the same day , the vision did not return . a-68-year - old man noticed a sudden loss of vision in his right eye when he woke up . he was examined in our hospital the same day and his best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) was no light perception in the right eye and 1.2 in the left eye . the pupillary light reflex was almost absent in the right eye , and a relative afferent pupillary defect was present . fundus examination showed no optic disc edema and atrophy , and spontaneous venous pulsations were not present . the macular area was normal , and optociliary shunt vessels were not present . from the clinical findings , we suspected a retrobulbar lesion and ordered an orbital computed tomography ( ct ) on the same day . his history included nasal polypectomy more than 20 years earlier , and asthma that was not being treated . the ct scan also showed pan - sinusitis , multilobular nasal polyps , and a defect of the sphenoid bone ( figures 1a c ) . the laboratory data showed no elevation of the white blood cell count , eosinophilia , and c reactive protein . we consulted an otorhinolaryngologist on the same day , and an emergency endoscopic sinus surgery ( ess ) was performed . intraoperatively , the ethmoid , maxillary , and sphenoidal sinuses were filled with highly viscous mucosal fluid . in addition , several polyps were found in the nasal cavity . after excision of the polyps and thickened mucosa and drainage of the mucosal fluid , an erosion and thinning of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus bone and partial defects of the optic canal were found . the optic canal was cleared to try to decompress the optic nerve , and betamethasone was applied to the exposed optic nerve to try to suppress the inflammatory changes . no fungal hyphae were detected by grocott and periodic acid schiff ( pas ) staining ( figures 2a d ) . unfortunately , the right visual acuity did not improve and remained at no light perception in spite of the postoperative betamethasone ( total 324 mg ) . six months later , nasal polyps recurred and nasal administration of betamethasone was started and is currently being continued . the laboratory data showed an elevation of total ige and eosinophils compared to that before the surgery ( before 1.2 and post - surgery 6.2 ) . the specific iges against candida and aspergillus were negative with the radioallergosorbent ( rast ) test . chronic rhinosinusitis ( crs ) is a chronic inflammation of the rhinosinus mucosa and is characterized by the presence of two or more symptoms , viz . nasal discharge , nasal obstruction , post - nasal drip , and reduction or loss of the sense of smell . the diagnosis of crs is made by the signs and symptoms that remain for longer than 3 months and opacification of the sinus in x - ray and ct images . although crs is common , its subclassification , pathology , and treatment have still not been completely established . cases of crs have been divided into two groups ; chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( crswnps ) and chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps ( crssnps ) in europe and the united states . crswnps has a strong predisposition to recurrences even after ess , and pathological examinations show numerous eosinophils invading the mucosa . in contrast , crssnp is diagnosed by purulent changes , and histopathological examinations of the nasal polyps and nasal mucosa show lymphocytes and neutrophils as the dominant inflammatory invaders . however , some cases of crswnp in asians do not show eosinophil - dominant changes in the inflammation . in addition , this subtype is not fully resolved by conventional long - term macrolide therapy combined with surgical dissection of the mucosal membrane in the sinuses . these cases have recently been classified as ecrs because they have different clinical characteristics from the more common crss that are associated with asthma , elevation of eosinophilic counts in peripheral blood , and massive invasion of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa . the diagnosis of ecrs is finally determined by the clinical findings of chronic nasal symptoms , results of imaging tests , peripheral blood tests , and histological tests.4 our case had the nasal symptoms , history of nasal polypectomy , and asthma . ct showed pan - sinusitis , and histopathological examination of removed mucosal membranes showed intensive invasion of eosinophils . furthermore , there was a recurrence after surgery and steroid therapy . from the findings and clinical course , our case was diagnosed as ecrs and not the purulent type of crs . unlike the purulent type of crs , the ocular complications of ecrs have not been fully determined . garg et al reported a case of ecrs associated with optic neuropathy.5 the mri images showed a high intensity area over the left intraorbital optic nerve without any lesions in the paranasal sinuses . they treated their case with steroid therapy and radical sphenoethmoid clearance , however the visual acuity , which was light perception before treatment , improved only slightly to finger counting . fungi have received much attention in the united states as candidates for causing ecrs and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis ( afs ) . the diagnostic criteria for afs include type 1 hypersensitivity to fungi , nasal polyps , and eosinophilic mucin containing fungi.7 it was suggested that fungi in the sinonasal mucosa might be the cause of non - atopic eosinophilia or local ige production.8 the clinical findings of afs overlap those of ecrs , and thus it is necessary to differentiate afs from ecrs . generally , cases with afs have unilateral lesions , elevation of eosinophils , and ige specific to fungal antigen . the important findings for diagnosis of afs are the detection of hyphal forms of fungi and positive histopathological findings with pas or grocott staining . as with ecrs , afs is rarely associated with optic neuropathy.6 the orbital findings of afs are proptosis , ophthalmoplegia , optic neuropathy , and telecanthus . imaging tests show hyper - attenuating foci along with expansion and destruction of the sinus walls . most cases of optic neuropathy have an erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid and optic canal.6 the incidence of bony erosion in afs is more than 12 times greater than in non - afs.9 whether an erosion of sphenoid bone occurs may determine the visual prognosis . there is potential for mistaking the size of the lesion with only mri.10 mri of cases with allergic aspergillus sinusitis showed that the lesions were low intensity cystic lesions in both t1 and t2 weighted images . thus , the lesions may appear to be smaller than the actual size unless enhanced mri is used . by contrast , ct can accurately detect the area of hyper - attenuation and bone architecture . our case progressed to bilateral lesions , and the laboratory data were negative for ige specific to fungi . in addition , there were no hyphae in the biopsy sections with pas and grocott staining . from these findings it was not definitively determined why the visual acuity did not recover even though the ess was performed within 30 hours after the initial symptoms of optic neuropathy developed . our case presented with pan - sinusitis and thick mucosal membrane overall of the rhinosinus including the middle meatus and osteomeatal complex . although the inflammatory changes gradually enlarged after the polypectomy , the drainage from the parasinus might have been blocked leading to infection and inflammatory changes . these changes could then cause the internal pressure in the parasinus to increase and affect the optic canal , even though bacterial infectious changes were not detected . in addition , local ischemia of the optic nerve might also have occurred secondary to the erosion of the optic canal followed by swelling of the optic nerve because the visual loss was so rapid . an earlier case of ecrs with optic neuropathy had a different mri performed and an enhancement of the intraorbital optic nerve without extensive opacification of the rhinosinus was found . although we did not do mri , direct invasion by inflammatory tissues might have occurred in the right optic nerve as seen in the previous case . in conclusion , we documented a rare case of ecrs complicated by optic neuropathy . unfortunately , the visual acuity did not recover at all even though emergency ess and steroid therapy were performed . these findings indicate that it is very important to suppress the allergic reaction for the prevention of ocular complications in ecrs cases .

old female was referred to our department with severe visual impairment for months . she was quite healthy until 1 year ago when she began to suffer recurrent episodes of uveitis with mutton fat keratic precipitates ( kps ) in both eyes . on presentation , ocular examination showed mild anterior uveitis with mutton fat kps and dense vitreous hemorrhage in both eyes . systemic workup including general physical examination , complete blood counting , differential classification , blood biochemical tests , rheumatic factor , antinuclear antibody , human immunodeficiency virus , venereal disease research laboratory test , anticardiolipin antibody , and chest radiography were within normal ranges . due to persistent vitreous hemorrhage and disabled vision , pars plana vitrectomy was performed in the left eye and then the right eye 2 months later . sign of peripheral vasculitis with nodular choroid infiltration was noted during operation in both eyes . gallium-67 scans showed panda sign of increased uptake in lacrimal glands and lambda sign of lymph nodes in the mediastinum ( fig . 1 ) . chest computed tomography ( ct ) showed a small ground glass opacity nodule in the subpleural space of the right lower lobe , more in favor of inflammatory process . based on these findings , ocular sarcoidosis was impressed and systemic and topical steroids administered in a tapering dose over 6 months . unfortunately , painless enlargement of lymph node at her right neck was noted 6 years later . lymph node biopsy showed granuloma with caseous necrosis , langhans giant cell , as well as acid -

ray , aqueous tb culture , and pcr . tuberculin skin test was not done as our cdc did not identify the significance of ppd in adult who received routine bacille calmette guerin vaccination . the ocular inflammation revolved after systemic steroid , and remained silent even at the presence of tb lymphadenopathy . our speculation is that the presumed ocular sarcoidosis might be triggered by tb antigen in extraocular infection , which reactivated and presented as tb lymphadenopathy 6 years later . tb could occur coincidently or in association with sarcoidosis , continued follow - up is important for patients with ocular sarcoidosis , even in silent case .

69 years . according to ethnicity in malaysia , women of indian ethnic group have the highest incidence for cervical cancer followed by chinese and malay ( 3 ) . majority malays are muslims , thus lower incidence of this cancer was observed . in iran , there are almost no extramarital sexual relations and they depend strongly on family - based traditions ( 7 ) the five - year survival exceeded 70 in korea ( 810 ) , 55 in turkey ( 11 ) and it can be as low as 17 which was in uganda ( 12 ) . there were various prognostic factors established in many studies such as stage , age , lymph node involvement and tumor size ( 1316 ) . in kentucky , between january 2001 and may 2010 , a study of 381 cervical cancer patients who were referred to tertiary care centre found that stage of disease was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival ( 17 ) . meanwhile , a study of 44,182 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1993 and 2002 in korea , found that both stage and histological type of cervical cancer were important factors for survival ( 18 ) . to our knowledge , the analysis from published studies was often limited to the frequently used cox proportional hazard regression model when examining the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates ( 17 , 1921 ) . this is perhaps due to the fact that although baseline hazard is not specified in cox model , the parameter can still be estimated . the objective of this study was to determine the effects of explanatory variables on the survival of cervical cancer patients using parametric regression model . in some cases , parametric models are more informative than the cox model such as the baseline hazard and survival estimates are known ( can be estimated ) . several examples of parametric models can be found in the following studies ( 2227 ) . zhu et al . have compared the cox and weibull model in modeling the gastric cancer data and found that the weibull model gave more a precise results in than the cox model ( 28 ) . the weibull model has gained popularity in modeling survival data due to its flexibility in the shape parameter that can accommodate a decreasing , constant and increasing hazard . furthermore , the suitability of the weibull model can be easily assessed using a log - cumulative hazard plot . in this study , a stratified weibull model was used since there was a time - dependent covariate that caused the proportional hazard assumption vio - lated . the study design was retrospective in nature in which patients records were reviewed retrospectively to obtain the data . the husm , located in kubang kerian , kelantan has been long regarded as the referral centre for the east coast region of malaysia . the inclusion criteria were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed with cancer of cervix between 1 july 1995 and 30 june 2007 , and received at least one treatment related to cervical cancer in husm . patients who were died due to other competing causes of death ( not cervical cancer ) , or with incomplete data were excluded from this study . ethical clearance was obtained from research and ethics committee of university sains malaysia ( reference number : usmkk ppp jepem 205.4 ( 2.4 ) ) . the variable of interest was time ( in months ) which was measured from the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer up to the time of death . factors that were considered in the analysis were ethnicity ( non malay , malay ) , lymph node involvement ( negative , positive ) , metastasis ( with metastasis , without metastasis ) , histology ( squamous cell carcinoma , adeno cell carcinoma ) , primary treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy andor chemotherapy ) , age at diagnosis ( 40 , 40 59 , 60 ) and stage ( stage i ii , stage iii iv ) . international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ( figo ) system was used in staging patients with cervical cancer . data analysis was performed using the statistical package tibco spotfire s - plus version 8.1 . the suitability of the weibull model for the data was assessed using a plot of the log of the negative log of the estimated survivor function against log time or log - cumulative hazard plot . univariate analysis was conducted using the simple weibull regression analysis to identify the possible prognostic factors individually . significant factors from the univariate analysis were further analyzed by the weibull multivariate analysis to model the prognostic factors . model selection procedure was based on the forward variable selection method with statistical significance set at 0.10 . the proportionality of the hazards was assessed using the test based on schoenfeld ( 29 ) . as the proportional hazard assumption was not satisfied , a stratified model was used instead ( 30 ) and in measuring the goodness of fit of the model , deviance residuals were used . 1 shows a study flow diagram which summarizes the steps of the statistical analysis performed . the study flow diagram the log - cumulative hazard plotshows a straight line which suggests that the distribution of survival time considered follows weibull distribution ( fig . patients characteristics and the incidence rate ratio were tabulated in table 1 . about 74 of total patients the ratio of the risk of death for patients who were diagnosed in stage iii iv compared to the risk of death for patients in group stage i ii was 1.44 . meanwhile , the risk of dying of patients in with metastasis group was 1.55 , greater than patients who had no metastasis . the results from the univariate analysis are presented in table 2 . from this analysis , based on the forward selection procedure in multivariate analysis , two variables namely stage and metastasis was found to be significant factors ( table 3 ) . however , it was noted that metastasis ( p0.032 ) did not satisfy the proportional hazard assumption and a stratified model was then considered . it is worthwhile to note that while the stratification allows separate baseline hazard function to each metastasis group , the coefficient of the predictor variables are assumed to be the same within each metastasis group ( 29 ) . the first stratum consists of patients without metastasis and the second stratum were patients who do have metastasis . parameter estimates of the stratified model were performed and the output is given in table 4 . the log - cumulative hazard plot characteristics of patients treated in husm ( n120 ) univariate analysis of weibull model with prognostic factors multivariate analysis of weibull model with prognostic factors output of weibull model under stratification the hazard ratio for variable stage stratified on metastasis the estimated scale parameters ( ) for the first and second stratum were 1 1.11 and 2 0.733 respectively . the risks of death for cervical cancer patients were estimated by finding the regression coefficient ( j ) jj , and the hazard ratio ( j ) j exp(j ) where j 1,2 denotes the stratum . for the first stratum , patients who were diagnosed at stage iii iv are at 2.30 times the risk of death as those in stage i ii . meanwhile , for the second stratum , patients in stage iii iv group were more likely to die ( 3.53 times ) than patients in stage i ii . the index plot of deviance residuals ( rdi ) was performed to identify the presence of subjects who was poorly predicted by the model ( 31 ) . 3 shows that the residuals are roughly symmetrically distributed around zero and most of the residuals are between -2 to 2 . outliers and influential observations are not observed in the plot thus implying a good fit of the model . in this study , the weibull model was used instead of the cox model because the log - cumulative hazard plot has confirmed that the survival time followed the weibull distribution . multivariate analysis through forward selection method found that the most feasible model to describe the survival of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the covariates namely , stage and metastasis . as the metastasis variable did not meet the proportional hazard assumption , the stratified weibull model was applied . this study found that patients who were diagnosed at stage iii iv have greater risk of death compared to those who were diagnosed at early stage , stage i ii for both stratum , with and without metastasis . it is worthwhile to note that a study of 515 cervical cancer patients by dueas - gonzlez et al . showed a significant result for advance stage iii iv with adjusted hazard ratio of 1.54 ( 95 ci 1.11- 2.14 ) ( 16 ) , indicating that patients with advanced stage of disease had a 54 higher risk of progression or death at any time than earlier stage patients . after applying the stratified model , this study found that the prognosis of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the stage at diagnosis . these findings provide useful knowledge on the understanding of the survival of cervical cancer patients . besides , this study also demonstrates the solution to time - dependent covariates problem , or when the proportional hazards assumption is violated . cervical cancer dataset that comprise of the national data may be obtained to give a more general prognosis and a better description of the survival pattern of all cervical cancer patients in malaysia . ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication andor falsification , double publication andor submission , redundancy , etc ) have been completely observed by the authors .

            " Text: the online version of this article ( doi:10.1007s40121 - 015 - 0094 - 6 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . extended spectrum -lactamases ( esbl ) are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing penicillins , broad - spectrum cephalosporins , and monobactams . these infections increase cost of care if inappropriate therapy , defined as non - susceptibility of pathogen to therapy by laboratory criteria , is administered . at present , the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( eucast ) do not recommend routine screening for esbls or subsequent phenotypic confirmation testing that had been advocated previously 3 , 4 . while this approach has been supported in the clinical practice setting by the introduction of reduced breakpoints for many beta - lactams , it may be of value , particularly when evaluating novel therapies , to understand the potency of various agents against esbl producers . however , if one utilizes esbl classification with aztreonam ( atm ) , ceftriaxone ( cro ) , or ceftazidime ( caz ) minimum inhibitory concentrations ( mic ) as a simple screen , without phenotypic confirmation via the clavulanate test , this approach may include other resistant genotypes ( i. e. carbapenemase producers ) that may not accurately predict the clinical utility of therapeutic agents under consideration . phenotypic screening tests to detect resistance mechanisms such as carbapenemase production or ampc expression are available and can be used . while molecular testing would yield the most definite results , it is also cost prohibitive and unavailable to most clinical microbiological laboratories . in this study , we tested the recently us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved compound , ceftolozane tazobactam ( c t ) , which has demonstrated in vitro activity against some esbl organisms . the purpose of this study was to compare the impact of mic - based screening versus confirmatory testing of esbls on the susceptibility profile of c t versus selected antimicrobials . in this study , 44 us hospitals collected non - duplicate , non - urine escherichia coli ( n 1306 ) and klebsiella pneumoniae ( n 1205 ) over the period of june 2013 and october 2014 . participating sites identified the organisms using their established method and then transferred each isolate to trypticase soy agar slants for shipping . isolates were transferred onto trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 sheep blood at the central processing laboratory ( center for anti - infective research and development , hartford hospital , hartford hospital , hartford , ct , usa ) for mic determination using broth microdilution as described by clsi . mics were determined for c t , cefepime ( fep ) , cro , caz , ciprofloxacin ( cip ) , atm , ertapenem ( etp ) , piperacillin tazobactam ( tzp ) , meropenem ( mem ) , and tobramycin ( tob ) against this collection of 2511 contemporary clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates . c t was provided by cubist pharmaceuticals , while all others antibiotics were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st . e. coli 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 were utilized as quality control strains as recommended by clsi . clsi states that the initial mic - based esbl screening for e. coli and k. pneumoniae should be performed by evaluating the mic profile of one of the following drugs : cefpodoxime 4 g ml , caz 1 g ml , atm 1 g ml , or cefotaxime 1 g ml . it is noted that the use of more than one of these agents will improve detection of esbls . we defined a positive esbl screen as having an mic of 1 g ml to 2 of the following : atm , cro , or caz . subsequent clsi defined , phenotypic , esbl confirmation studies were undertaken using caz and cefotaxime with and without clavulanate . probable carbapenemase - producing organisms were excluded based on etp ( 1 g ml ) or mem ( 2 g ml ) susceptibility profiles . while molecular - based confirmation of these enzymes would have been definitive , methodologies readily available to the clinical microbiology laboratory were utilized . recently , c t has been approved in the us and susceptibility interpretative criteria have now been provided by the fda of 2 g ml for the enterobacteriaceae . this surveillance program was reviewed by the institutional review board ( irb ) at the coordinating center , hartford hospital . since all samples were collected as part of routine medical care and no interventions were undertaken as a result of this testing , informed consent was deemed unnecessary by the irb . four - hundred and forty - two ( 18 ) isolates e. coli ( n 231 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 211 ) screened positive for esbl production based on mic - based criteria . of these , 274 ( 62 ) isolates e. coli ( n 146 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 128 ) were phenotypically confirmed positive for esbl production . with further exclusion of the 28 ( 10 ) isolates e. coli ( n 13 ) , k. pneumoniae ( n 14 ) that demonstrated carbapenem non - susceptible , a left shift in the mic distribution ( i. e. enhanced potency ) against phenotypically confirmed esbl was noted for c t , etp , tzp , and mem ( table 1 ) . figure 1 highlights these screening- and confirmation - based observations for c t and tzp . improvements in s between 8 and 17 were noted for confirmed versus screened - positive esbl isolates for c t , etp , tzp , and mem . ( table 1 ) overall , s of the other -lactams , tob and cip , was poor against phenotypically confirmed esbls . comparing the mic90 values for all esbl mic - based screen - positive versus phenotypically confirmed positive , we observed a reduction of twofold for c t , sixfold for etp , and eightfold for mem ( table 2). table 1percent susceptibility of all agents against mic -

october over a 3-year period from 2010 - 2012 . culicoides nipponensis tokunaga was the most commonly collected species ( 42.9 ) , followed by culicoides erairai kono and takahasi ( 29.2 ) , culicoides punctatus ( meigen ) ( 20.3 ) , culicoides arakawae ( arakawa ) ( 3.3 ) , c. pallidulus ( 1.8 ) , and culicoides circumscriptus kieffer ( 1.4 ) , while the remaining 10 species accounted for only 1.1 of all culicoides spp . collected ( table 1 ) . c. nipponensis was the most frequently collected species ( females and males ) at daeseongdong village ( 67.1 ) , and was commonly collected from the nnsc camp ( 35.6 ) , tongilchon ( 33.9 ) , and warrior base ( 19.5 ) . c. erairai was the most frequently collected species at nnsc camp ( 53.6 ) and accounted for 85.1 of c. erairai collected at all 4 sites ( table 1 ) , while c. punctatus was the most frequently collected species at both tongilchon ( 54.4 ) and warrior base ( 28.7 ) . c. nipponensis females demonstrated bimodal capture rates , with large numbers collected during may ( 1,754 , 82.4 ) , june ( 1,479 , 29.5 ) , and then again during september ( 3,332 , 81.7 ) ( table 2 ) . c. erairai was more frequently collected during june ( 2,962 , 59.2 ) and july ( 2,154 , 76.0 ) followed by a sharp decline in numbers collected from august - october . c. punctatus was collected infrequently from may - september ( range , 84 - 372 ) with large numbers only collected during october ( 2,756 , 88.0 ) . overall , low numbers of c. nipponensis were collected during 2011 , while higher numbers were observed during may - june and again during september 2012 at the nnsc camp and daeseongdong ( fig . 2 ) . c. erairai was collected more frequently at the nnsc camp during the months of june - july 2011 and 2012 , with few collected from august - october for either year . low numbers of c. punctatus were collected from may - september , with a sharp increases in numbers observed primarily at the beef farm at tongilchon during october for both 2011 and 2012 . this is the first report for collections of culicoides using mosquito magnet traps that use only heat and co2 as attractants . the addition of other chemical attractants , e. g. octenol , has been shown to repel some species of culicine mosquitoes , while enhancing the collection of others , but the relative attractiveness of this attractant has not been investigated for most species of culicoides . a major difference between mosquito magnet and light traps is that mosquito magnet traps operate continuously without bias toward nocturnal and diurnal active species . this difference , however , indicates that comparative analysis between data obtained from mosquito magnet and light traps should be viewed with caution . biting midges are both nuisance biters and vectors of medical and veterinary important pathogens that impact the economy of the animal industry in the rok . c. nipponensis , and c. punctatus were the most commonly collected species by mosquito magnets during this study and have been associated with the transmission of important livestock pathogens , e. g. fukuoka , aino , and ibaraki viruses , or as biting pests of humans ( c. erairai ) . consequently , surveillance of these and other species of culicoides and associated pathogens are an important part of the veterinary health service to identify relative vector populations , their distributions throughout the rok , and the presence and prevalence of pathogens affecting livestock and poultry . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus in the mosquito magnet collections is similar to findings by cho and chong and kang and yu using new jersey light traps . similarly , lee found that c. punctatus , c. arakawae , and c. tainanus kieffer were the most commonly collected species at inland sites , whereas c. nipponensis and c. sinanoensis tokunaga were the predominant species collected from the south and eastern coastal areas in the rok . recently kim et al . found that c. punctatus and c. arakawae were the dominant species collected from light traps set in 9 cowsheds in the southern part of the rok . the unprecedented predominance of c. erairai and relatively low numbers of c. arakawae in the mosquito magnet traps compared to these and other previous reports may reflect the relative attraction of these species to light and the attractants associated with the mosquito magnet traps . the dominance of c. nipponensis and c. punctatus at a cowshed at tongilchon agrees with the host preference of these species for cattle . although c. arakawae appears to have a preference for feeding on birds , it also readily feeds on cattle , which would explain its abundance around cowsheds in other reports but not the low numbers collected at the cowshed at tongilchon in this survey . the variable distribution of culicoides spp . over a limited area ( 2 km radius ) demonstrates the focal species abundance due to little understood environmental and host attraction factors . for example , high numbers of c. erairai were observed at the nnsc camp where humans are believed to be the primary host , while c. nipponensis was the primary species collected at daeseongdong and tongilchon where a variety of hosts ( e. g. cattle , dogs , large water birds , and humans ) serve as potential hosts . thus , further studies comparing light and mosquito magnet traps and range of available hosts may reveal differential attraction for different species and assist in surveys targeting particular species . additionally , studies on the geographical and seasonal distributions , host attraction ( e. g. placement of traps near human habitation and poultry , cattle , and swine farms ) , temporal biting activity , pathogen infection rates , and their role as potential vectors of zoonotic pathogens that impact on human and animal health are warranted . although limited , the data presented herein provide a better understanding of the biology , ecology , and environmental parameters that affect relative population abundance of culicoides spp . that can be used to predict potential human and animal health risks and develop and implement mitigation strategies .
