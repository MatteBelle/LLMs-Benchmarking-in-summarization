leading cause of death among women in malaysia(1 - 3 ) . it remains to be one of the major cancers that burden worldwide particularly in under - developed and developing countries ( cervical cancer incidence rate increased with age after 30 years and has its peak at ages 65 - 69 years . according to ethnicity in malaysia , women of indian ethnic group have the highest incidence for cervical cancer followed by chinese and malay ( 3 ) . majority malays are muslims , thus lower incidence of this cancer was observed . in iran , there are almost no extramarital sexual relations and they depend strongly on family - based traditions ( 7 ) the five - year survival exceeded 70 in korea ( 810 ) , 55 in turkey ( 11 ) and it can be as low as 17 which was in uganda ( 12 ) . there were various prognostic factors established in many studies such as stage , age , lymph node involvement and tumor size ( 1316 ) . in kentucky , between january 2001 and may 2010 , a study of 381 cervical cancer patients who were referred to tertiary care centre found that stage of disease was a significant prognostic factor for overall survival ( 17 ) . meanwhile , a study of 44,182 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1993 and 2002 in korea , found that both stage and histological type of cervical cancer were important factors for survival ( 18 ) . to our knowledge , the analysis from published studies was often limited to the frequently used cox proportional hazard regression model when examining the relationship of the survival distribution to covariates ( 17 , 1921 ) . this is perhaps due to the fact that although baseline hazard is not specified in cox model , the parameter can still be estimated . the objective of this study was to determine the effects of explanatory variables on the survival of cervical cancer patients using parametric regression model . in some cases , parametric models are more informative than the cox model such as the baseline hazard and survival estimates are known ( can be estimated ) . several examples of parametric models can be found in the following studies ( 2227 ) . zhu et al . have compared the cox and weibull model in modeling the gastric cancer data and found that the weibull model gave more a precise results in than the cox model ( 28 ) . the weibull model has gained popularity in modeling survival data due to its flexibility in the shape parameter that can accommodate a decreasing , constant and increasing hazard . furthermore , the suitability of the weibull model can be easily assessed using a log - cumulative hazard plot . in this study , a stratified weibull model was used since there was a time - dependent covariate that caused the proportional hazard assumption vio - lated . the study design was retrospective in nature in which patients records were reviewed retrospectively to obtain the data . the husm , located in kubang kerian , kelantan has been long regarded as the referral centre for the east coast region of malaysia . the inclusion criteria were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed with cancer of cervix between 1 july 1995 and 30 june 2007 , and received at least one treatment related to cervical cancer in husm . patients who were died due to other competing causes of death ( not cervical cancer ) , or with incomplete data were excluded from this study . ethical clearance was obtained from research and ethics committee of university sains malaysia ( reference number : usmkk ppp jepem 205.4 ( 2.4 ) ) . the variable of interest was time ( in months ) which was measured from the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer up to the time of death . factors that were considered in the analysis were ethnicity ( non malay , malay ) , lymph node involvement ( negative , positive ) , metastasis ( with metastasis , without metastasis ) , histology ( squamous cell carcinoma , adeno cell carcinoma ) , primary treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy andor chemotherapy ) , age at diagnosis ( 40 , 40 59 , 60 ) and stage ( stage i ii , stage iii iv ) . international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ( figo ) system was used in staging patients with cervical cancer . data analysis was performed using the statistical package tibco spotfire s - plus version 8.1 . the suitability of the weibull model for the data was assessed using a plot of the log of the negative log of the estimated survivor function against log time or log - cumulative hazard plot . univariate analysis was conducted using the simple weibull regression analysis to identify the possible prognostic factors individually . significant factors from the univariate analysis were further analyzed by the weibull multivariate analysis to model the prognostic factors . model selection procedure was based on the forward variable selection method with statistical significance set at 0.10 . the proportionality of the hazards was assessed using the test based on schoenfeld ( 29 ) . as the proportional hazard assumption was not satisfied , a stratified model was used instead ( 30 ) and in measuring the goodness of fit of the model , deviance residuals were used . 1 shows a study flow diagram which summarizes the steps of the statistical analysis performed . the study flow diagram the log - cumulative hazard plotshows a straight line which suggests that the distribution of survival time considered follows weibull distribution ( fig . patients characteristics and the incidence rate ratio were tabulated in table 1 . about 74 of total patients the ratio of the risk of death for patients who were diagnosed in stage iii iv compared to the risk of death for patients in group stage i ii was 1.44 . meanwhile , the risk of dying of patients in with metastasis group was 1.55 , greater than patients who had no metastasis . the results from the univariate analysis are presented in table 2 . from this analysis , based on the forward selection procedure in multivariate analysis , two variables namely stage and metastasis was found to be significant factors ( table 3 ) . however , it was noted that metastasis ( p0.032 ) did not satisfy the proportional hazard assumption and a stratified model was then considered . it is worthwhile to note that while the stratification allows separate baseline hazard function to each metastasis group , the coefficient of the predictor variables are assumed to be the same within each metastasis group ( 29 ) . the first stratum consists of patients without metastasis and the second stratum were patients who do have metastasis . parameter estimates of the stratified model were performed and the output is given in table 4 . the log - cumulative hazard plot characteristics of patients treated in husm ( n120 )

stage stratified on metastasis the estimated scale parameters ( ) for the first and second stratum were 1 1.11 and 2 0.733 respectively . the risks of death for cervical cancer patients were estimated by finding the regression coefficient ( j ) jj , and the hazard ratio ( j ) j exp(j ) where j 1,2 denotes the stratum . for the first stratum , patients who were diagnosed at stage iii iv are at 2.30 times the risk of death as those in stage i ii . meanwhile , for the second stratum , patients in stage iii iv group were more likely to die ( 3.53 times ) than patients in stage i ii . the index plot of deviance residuals ( rdi ) was performed to identify the presence of subjects who was poorly predicted by the model ( 31 ) . 3 shows that the residuals are roughly symmetrically distributed around zero and most of the residuals are between -2 to 2 . outliers and influential observations are not observed in the plot thus implying a good fit of the model . in this study , the weibull model was used instead of the cox model because the log - cumulative hazard plot has confirmed that the survival time followed the weibull distribution . multivariate analysis through forward selection method found that the most feasible model to describe the survival of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the covariates namely , stage and metastasis . as the metastasis variable did not meet the proportional hazard assumption , the stratified weibull model was applied . this study found that patients who were diagnosed at stage iii iv have greater risk of death compared to those who were diagnosed at early stage , stage i ii for both stratum , with and without metastasis . it is worthwhile to note that a study of 515 cervical cancer patients by dueas - gonzlez et al . showed a significant result for advance stage iii iv with adjusted hazard ratio of 1.54 ( 95 ci 1.11- 2.14 ) ( 16 ) , indicating that patients with advanced stage of disease had a 54 higher risk of progression or death at any time than earlier stage patients . after applying the stratified model , this study found that the prognosis of cervical cancer patients was dependent upon the stage at diagnosis . these findings provide useful knowledge on the understanding of the survival of cervical cancer patients . besides , this study also demonstrates the solution to time - dependent covariates problem , or when the proportional hazards assumption is violated . cervical cancer dataset that comprise of the national data may be obtained to give a more general prognosis and a better description of the survival pattern of all cervical cancer patients in malaysia . ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication andor falsification , double publication andor submission , redundancy , etc ) have been completely observed by the authors .\",\n          \"functional residual capacity , frc , is the lung volume at the end of a relaxed expiration to atmospheric pressure . the frc is affected by lung diseases and thus is a central measure for diagnosis , treatment and monitoring in anesthesia and intensive care . the calculation of frc from measurement of multiple breath nitrogen washout ( mbnw ) when abruptly changing the fraction of inspired oxygen ( fio2 ) was introduced by darling . the method entailed the measurement of the mixed expiratory fraction of nitrogen before and after a step increase in oxygen and can be explained with the following simple example . the inspired fraction of oxygen , fio2 , is 0.21 and the balance is n2 , i. e. fin2 0.79 . assume dry alveolar fractions of o2 0.16 , fao2 , of n2 0.79 , fan2 , and of co2 0.05 , faco2 . if the equilibrium between fin2 and fan2 is disrupted by having the person inhale at fio2 of 1 while exhaling into a bag , eventually all alveolar nitrogen will be transferred to the bag . frc equals vn2 divided by the change in fraction of nitrogen that was in the lung :

advent of the nitrogen analyzer , the mass spectrometer and the use of high precision spirometers the washout could be followed on a breath - by - breath basis . this refinement eliminated the need for the bag and replaced the numerator in equation ( 1 ) with the expired volumes of nitrogen summed over the number of breaths . the modification is heavily reliant on the exact synchronization of analysis of fn2 and expired volume for the calculation of breath - by - breath volume of nitrogen . the example above utilized fio2 to step fan2 from 0.79 to 0 . instead , any step change in fio2 could be used to create a corresponding step change in nitrogen . established the ratio of functional residual air , r , divided by the sum of functional residual air and effective tidal volume , t , as dilution rate , r , describing the nitrogen clearance curve : documentclass12ptminimal usepackageamsmath usepackagewasysym usepackageamsfonts usepackageamssymb usepackageamsbsy usepackagemathrsfs usepackageupgreek setlengthoddsidemargin-69pt begindocument$$ r fracrr tprime . this factor multiplied by initial alveolar fraction of nitrogen and raised to the power of breath number allowed for the calculation of fraction of nitrogen in the expired volume of air . fowler expanded the concept of the alveolar dilution factor to encompass three lung phases and introduced the term pulmonary nitrogen clearance delay , adding another characterization of the nitrogen clearance curve . the list has since been extended by investigators in pulmonary physiology , see 8 , 9 . recently , a modification of the mbnw method has been introduced , implicitly utilizing a first order difference equation for the calculation of frc based on mass conservation and a change in fio2 of 0.1 . in the present study , the difference equation is solved for the step response using basic digital signal processing ( dsp ) techniques where the step is interpreted as the nitrogen fraction change initiating the measurement . the resulting step response equation by comparing calculated clearance data to experimental and clinical washout data . finally , we discuss technical and clinical limitations in addition to characteristics of the measurement . the first order difference equation based on mass conservation of nitrogen over one breath after a step change in inhaled n2 fraction is described in

enddocument \",\n          \"laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia ( vih ) repair has gained wide acceptance and increased popularity over the past decade . multiple studies have documented the safety , technical feasibility , and efficacy of this technique . the extremely low rate of wound infection and recurrence are among the most important advantages of the laparoscopic approach . because the prosthetic mesh is placed intraabdominally , many surgeons use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ( eptfe ) grafts because of the low adhesive potential . , high cost , inferior handling characteristics , and poor incorporation into the tissues are among the drawbacks of eptfe mesh . another product , polypropylene ( pp ) nevertheless , long - term complications , such as severe adhesions , obstruction , and fistula formation , have been reported with pp . these complications seem to occur when the pp mesh is placed in direct contact with the serosal surface of the bowel . however , if omentum is interposed between the mesh and viscera , adhesions should not involve loops of bowel and should be restricted to omentum only . using this technique , franklin et al reported no adhesion - related complications in over 170 patients undergoing laparoscopic vih repair during a 30-month follow - up . between 1999 and 2001 , patients undergoing laparoscopic vih repair were prospectively enrolled in a surgical database . in 30 patients , pp mesh ( prolene , ethicon corporation , somerville , nj ) was used for the hernia repair ; omentum was interposed between the mesh and the underlying bowel . the mesh was secured in place with a hernia stapler along the edges and nonabsorbable transcutaneous sutures at the corners , taking care to ensure that the mesh overlapped the fascial defect by at least 3 cm in each direction . at a mean follow - up of 14 months twenty patients agreed and were studied using an acuson xp10 , 7 mhz linear transducer , supplemented by a curvilinear transducer when appropriate . a visceral slide technique was used specifically to detect adhesions . at the time of follow - up , all patients were also examined for hernia recurrence , wound infection , and seroma formation . satisfaction with the procedure ( completely somewhat not satisfied ) and pain at the operative site ( mild moderate severe ) were assessed by using a standard questionnaire . this method is based on the demonstration of intestinal movement at the abdominal wall interface during real - time ultrasound imaging . such movement may occur spontaneously as a result of respiratory excursions or may be induced by manual compression . during longitudinal surface scanning , a normal spontaneous visceral slide may range from 2 cm to more than 5 cm in distance . detection of a visceral slide that measures less than 1 cm is considered abnormal due to adhesions . this method is based on the demonstration of intestinal movement at the abdominal wall interface during real - time ultrasound imaging . such movement may occur spontaneously as a result of respiratory excursions or may be induced by manual compression . during longitudinal surface scanning , a normal spontaneous visceral slide may range from 2 cm to more than 5 cm in distance . detection of a visceral slide that measures less than 1 cm is considered abnormal due to adhesions . no detectable omental or bowel adhesions were found in more than half of the patients ( figure 1 ) . in some cases , mesh appeared to be somewhat corrugated , but normal visceral slide was detected in each instance ( figure 2 ) . five patients had omentum that appeared to be densely adherent to the pp mesh , as detected by the lack of a normal visceral slide . in one of these patients , the bowel was visibly tethered underneath the omentum but was not adherent to the mesh . one patient had tethered bowel at the edge of the hernia repair with thickened omentum underlying the mesh . in another patient , the falci - form ligament had been divided to complete the hernia repair in that case . the incidence of adhesions ( ) detected by ultra - sonography in 20 patents after laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia repair with polypropylene mesh and omental interposition . ultrasonogram of the patient after laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia repair : mesh ( arrow ) appears to be corrugated . nine patients had no pain at the surgery site , while 10 patients stated they experienced mild to moderate pain with activity , usually near the edges of the repair ( figure 3 ) . only 2 patients complained of severe pain at the site of repair . one of these patients described severe pain with activity even though she had been pain - free for 1 year after surgery . this patient was noted to have a small recurrence of the hernia just lateral to the edge of the mesh ( figure 4 ) . her initial repair 3 years earlier was accomplished using the separation of components technique , which led to a subsequent recurrence . ultrasonogram of the patient with the recurrent hernia : omental herniation ( thick arrow ) is seen just lateral to the mesh ( thin arrow ) . the reasons for less than complete satisfaction include unexpected postoperative pain in 1 patient and moderate crampy postoperative pain in a second patient . one patient had problems with a trocar site , and another patient felt that an area of attenuated fascia with underlying mesh constituted a recurrence . the use of prosthetic materials for the repair of a ventral incisional hernia has significantly decreased the number of recurrences for this condition . moreover , the laparoscopic approach has helped to reduce the number of infections , recurrences , and the length of hospital stay . the formation of adhesions has been studied in numerous experimental models . in 1 such study , increasing adhesion development was noted from day 1 to day 7 after placement of the prosthesis , but surfaces that were already covered with mesothelial cells did not show progression . thereafter , the bowel had a diminished tendency to form adhesions even in the absence of omentum . another animal model was used to compare adhesion formation after open and laparoscopic placement of mesh . the study demonstrated that the area of mesh covered with adhesions and the grade of the adhesions were significantly greater in both groups undergoing celiotomy compared with the adhesion formation in the laparoscopic group . on histologic examination , the vascularity of the animals that underwent incision through skin and fascia was increased and slower to regress than in the laparoscopically treated animals . in the clinical setting , pp mesh has been used previously for open vih repair with a very low rate of enterocutaneous fistula formation , but fistulas have been reported as late as 15 years after the procedure . in laparoscopic vih repair , pp has been combined with omental interposition as protection against bowel adhesions . colocutaneous fistula after laparoscopic vih hernia repair with intraperitoneal ptfe has also been reported ; in this case , the laparoscopic staples or external postoperative trauma may have played a role . ultrasound was used to detect adhesion formation at a time when this process was complete . visceral slide detection by ultrasound was described by kodama et al in 1992 and was again validated in a french study with intraoperative observation and was noted to have a sensitivity of 77 , specificity of 74 , and a negative predictive value of 84 . the data in our study were prospectively collected , but the overall number of patients was modest . nonetheless , a low recurrence and infection rate was confirmed as noted in other laparoscopic herniorrhaphy studies , and no mesh - related complications have been noted to date . only 1 case of bowel adhesions to the edge of the mesh was found using ultrasound scanning at 24-month follow - up . sixty - five percent of our patients did not have adhesions of bowel or omentum detectable on ultra - sound examination . this result is similar to that reported by franklin et al where two thirds of the patients had few or no adhesions . a decreased inflammatory response in the abdominal wall tissue might limit the inflammatory tissue reaction caused by the pp mesh in regards to adhesion with underlying viscera . the results of this study are important but somewhat limited by the fact that the results of individual sonographic examinations could not be independently verified . the negative predictive value of the visceral slide method is approximately 80 ; therefore , it is possible that some patients who were deemed free of adhesions might indeed have had mild or filmy adhesions not detectable by ultrasound . in any case , these adhesions , even if present are unlikely to have any clinical impact , because no visceral complications have been observed . late postoperative pain seemed to be mostly related to the suture points during strenuous activity . although it was noted by half of the patients , it usually did not require medication and did not interfere with work or recreational activities . we have now gone to the use of absorbable monofilament material for the transfascial sutures . our early results indicate that laparoscopic ventral incisional hernia repair with pp mesh and omental coverage is not associated with sonographically detectable visceral adhesions in most patients . moreover , visceral complications such as bowel obstruction or enterocutaneous fistula do not occur . further accrual of patients and careful follow - up is needed to better understand the problem of ventral hernias and their repair with mesh .\"\n        ],\n

from various federal states were submitted to the friedrich - loeffler - institut , federal research institute for animal health ( insel riems , germany ) , to confirm an sbv infection ( table ) and to further characterize these reemerging viruses . to evaluate sequence variations among sbv variants circulating in germany since 2011 , the original sbv isolate ( bh8011 ) and viruses isolated in 2012 from the blood of viremic sheep ( bh61912 ) or cattle ( d49512 - 1 and bh65212 ) were compared with 3 genomes obtained from the viruses in acutely infected adult cattle in 2014 ( bh11914 - 12 , bh11914 - 34 , bh13214 ) . rna was extracted by using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer s recommendations , and the open reading frames of all 3 genome segments ( large l , medium m , and small s segment ; primer sequences available on request ) were sequenced as described ( 7 ) . kp731865kp731882 ) . sequence alignments and translation in amino acids were supported by geneious version 7.1 ( biomatters , auckland , new zealand ) . we generated a maximum - likelihood tree ( hasegawa - kishino - yano model , 1,000 bootstrap replicates ) using mega5 ( 8) . for the phylogenetic analysis of the m segment , sequences previously obtained from organ samples from newborns malformed because of sbv infection also were integrated ( 7 ) . for the s segment ( 830-nt long ) , which encodes the nucleocapsid protein ( n ) and a nonstructural protein ( nss ) , the samples obtained from acutely infected animals in 2014 , bh61912 and bh65212 , were 100 identical to the original sbv strain bh8011 from 2011 . in the sample d49512 - 1 from 2012 , a single nucleotide was substituted ( technical appendix figure ) . the viral rna - dependent rna polymerase encoding l segment ( 6864 nt ) also showed high stability , and only a few nucleotide substitutions compared with bh8011 were found in the latest samples ( d49512 - 1 and bh65212 : 6 nt ; bh61912 : 10 nt ; bh11914 - 12 , bh11914 - 34 . and bh13214 : 18 nt ) . overall , sequence identity was 99.799.9 ( technical appendix figure ) . the m segment ( 4415-nt long ) encodes 2 glycoproteins ( gn and gc ) and a nonstructural protein ( nsm ) . it is the most variable genome segment of sbv and related viruses ( 7,9,10 ) . despite the identification of a highly variable region within the gc - coding sequence in viruses in malformed newborns ( 7,9 ) , there was a high sequence stability of the viruses detected in the blood of acutely infected adult animals ; all sequences clustered closely ( figure 1 ) . in contrast to the maximum of 77 nt and 43 aa substitutions or 12 aa deletions or 2 aa insertions found in organ samples of lambs or calves ( 7 ) , we detected only 612 nt and 2 aa ( bh61912 ) , 3 aa ( d49512 - 1 , bh11914 - 34 , bh13214 ) or 4 aa ( bh65212 , bh11914 - 12 ) substitutions ( technical appendix figure ) . because gn and gc are major immunogens of orthobunyaviruses ( 10 ) , the mutation hot spot was supposed to be involved in immune evasion mechanisms andor adaption of the cell tropism within the individual host ( 7,9 ) . however , insect - transmitted viruses such as sbv have to adapt to 2 hosts and undergo replication cycles in both the arthropod vector and the mammalian host . thus , the high sequence stability of virus strains detectable in viremic animals might be necessary for transmission to the vector . notably , in comparison with the original sbv isolate , ke substitutions at aa 746 and 1340 of the m segment were found in all other samples . because these mutations have now been consistently present for at least 2 years , they might have occurred during the adaptation to european ruminants or insects and could provide a growth advantage within the individual host or might be beneficial for transmission between host and vector . phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of the medium segment of schmallenberg virus samples isolated from blood of acutely infected animals in 2011 or 2012 ( blue ) or sequenced directly from the blood of viremic cattle in 2014 ( red ) and from organ samples of malformed newborns ( black ) ( 7 ) . scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site . to investigate whether the detected sequence variations correlated with any change in pathogenicity , 5 female sheep and 1 female calf were subcutaneously inoculated with pools of up to 5 serum or whole blood samples from 1 of the holdings with new cases confirmed in 2014 ( sheep 1 and 3 and the calf with samples from lower saxony ; sheep 2 , 4 , and 5 with samples from saxony permit no . blood samples were taken daily for the first 2 weeks after inoculation and analyzed by real - time reverse transcription pcr ( 11 ) . thereafter , serum samples were taken in weekly intervals and tested in a microneutralization assay ( 12 ) and a commercially available sbv antibody elisa ( i d screen schmallenberg virus competition ; idvet , grabels , france ) . the calf and sheep 25 became infected ; viral genome was detectable in their blood for 46 days ( figure 2 ) , which agrees with the short - lived viremia previously observed after experimental infection of cattle and sheep with the original sbv sample or the first cell culture isolate ( 1,13 ) . antibodies were first detected on day 7 after infection ( sheep 2 , sheep 5 ) or day 14 after infection ( calf , sheep 3 , sheep 4 ) in both tests . detection of schmallenberg virus genome in the blood of experimentally infected cattle and sheep , germany , 2014 . virus genome with a high sequence identity to the first sbv sample was repeatedly detected in the blood of acutely infected adult cattle , and in experimentally infected animals , viremia developed that was identical to the original sbv isolate . the renewed virus circulation during the 2014 vector season was observed primarily in an area less affected in the 2 previous years . the missing or markedly reduced virus circulation led to a decline in herd seroprevalence caused by a missing infection of the young stock ( 14,15 ) ; further reasons for the unexpected recurrence of sbv could be persistence within the insect vectors . as a consequence , the infection of naive animals in autumn 2014 resulted in an increasing frequency of the birth of malformed offspring in the following winter . comparison of the small- , medium- , and large - segment sequences of schmallenberg viruses isolated in 2012 from the blood of viremic ruminants or detected in 2014 in acutely infected adult cattle with the first sbv isolate from 2011 , germany .\",\n          \"hardware removal is indicated for infection , nonunion , failure of fixation , pain , soft tissue irritation , and anticipated strenuous activity after fracture healing 14 . during removal cases subsequent removal of broken hardware increases surgical time , and retained metalwork potentially complicates future surgeries ( figure 1 ) . although there have been several articles that have discussed titanium implant failure , most have discussed this issue within the context of hardware failure during fracture healing , and not particularly during removal of hardware 69 . to our knowledge , none have been specific to the elbow , which merits its own discussion due to its unique anatomy . the distal humerus of the elbow is unique in that is has a high ratio of cortical to cancellous bone . therefore , in this study we set out to investigate incidence of bone screw failure during hardware removal procedures and we were interested in comparing titanium and stainless steel bone screws because these are the most common types of metallic fracture implants in circulation . in addition , we set out to determine whether the duration of implantation and the anatomic location of the bone screws about the elbow were associated with bone screw failure during removal procedures . a better understanding of metallic hardware failure during removal procedures may help surgeons in the preoperative planning stages of these cases , in terms of surgical tool selection and staff availability . after institutional review board ( irb ) approval , all cases performed by orthopaedic trauma or upper extremity surgeons between 112000 and 1012009 at our level 1 trauma center were reviewed . inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) deep implant removal cases , ( 2 ) hardware removed from the distal humerus or the proximal ulna , and ( 3 ) isolated elbow injuries . the exclusion criteria were ( 1 ) cases that did not have relevant or inaccessible elbow x - rays , ( 2 ) single screw fragment extraction cases ( because in these cases the hardware had previously broke and was small in size , which we believe was not representative of the other screws being removed ) , ( 3 ) patients younger than 17 years , and ( 4 ) cases that were originally performed at an outside institution ( unavailable medical records ) . the factors considered were ( 1 ) whether or not the bone screws broke during removal and the type of implant metal used ( titanium alloy , ti6al4v or stainless steel ) , ( 2 ) the length of time between initial implantation and removal , where cases were divided into two groups based on a conservative estimate of the time period required for osseointegration of titanium implants 10 , 11 : one group was for cases where the duration of time between implantation and removal was less than 12 months and the second group was for cases where the duration between implantation and removal was 12 months or more ; and ( 3 ) anatomic location about the elbow ( distal humerus or proximal ulna ) . the data was extracted from the medical record . due to the small sample size , fisher  is exact test was used to determine statistical differences between two sets of categorical data . an independent t - test was used to compare the means of two independent groups . differences that had less than 0.05 probability of occurring from chance were considered statistically significant . we identified a total of 47 cases , of which 21 met the inclusion criteria . we carried out an independent t - test to determine if there were any differences between the ages of patients that had broken screws and those that did not , and no statistical significance was found , p 0.740 . out of 21 cases , screws broke during removal in 5 cases ( 23.8 ) . in 16 out of 21 cases , the reasons for hardware removal were infection in 721 cases , symptomatic , prominent hardware in 721 cases , nonunion in 621 cases , and contracture in 121 cases . 14 involved titanium alloy and 7 involved stainless steel implants . within the titanium hardware group , in 10 cases removal was uneventful , and in 4 cases , fracture of at least one screw occurred . in comparison , out of the 7 stainless steel hardware removal cases , there was one case that resulted in one or more broken screws . overall , compared to stainless steel , failure of titanium alloy screws during removal was not found to be statistically significant ( p 0.61 ) . in order to determine whether there were any association between the duration of implantation and hardware failure during removal , cases were divided into two groups : group ( 1 ) duration of hardware implantation was 12 months or less ( mean 7.7 , range two to 12 months ) , and group ( 2 ) : duration of implantation was more than 12 months ( mean 41.6 , range 16 to 74 months ) . twelve cases had hardware removed within 12 months of implantation and nine cases had hardware removed after 12 months of initial implantation . bone screws that were removed after 12 months of surgery were more likely to break during removal ( p 0.046 ) . when titanium screws were analyzed separately , those removed within 12 months of surgery were more likely to be removed intact as compared to those removed more than 12 months after implantation ( p 0.003 ) . the small number of stainless steel cases ( seven ) did not warrant statistical calculations . with respect to anatomic location , there were 12 distal humerus and 15 proximal ulna cases ( table 1 ) . six cases involved the distal humerus only , nine cases involved the proximal ulna only , and six cases had simultaneous proximal ulna and distal humerus involvement . in one case where titanium screws broke and in one case where stainless steel screws broke , it was unclear where the location was and these cases were discarded from the analysis . in general , bone screw failure was equally likely to occur when removed from the distal humerus and the proximal ulna ( p 0.28 ) . hardware failure during removal cases is a commonly seen problem in orthopaedics ( figure 1 ) . currently , there is no single hardware removal technique that is uniformly successful , and several different methods may be employed during the same case . such techniques include the use of screw extractors , trephines , extraction bolts , pliers , and various other devices . the purpose of this article was to determine the incidence of bone screw failure during hardware removal procedures , and we were interested in comparing titanium and stainless steel bone screws . in addition , we set out to determine whether the duration of implantation and the anatomic location of the bone screws about the elbow had any association with bone screw failure during removal procedures . we believe that prior knowledge of the type of metal implanted ( mainly titanium ) and the duration of implantation to be useful information that can help in the preoperative planning of hardware removal procedures . firstly , this may allow surgeons to request hardware removal kits , thus saving precious operative time . second , it is our experience that hardware removal procedures are often considered not technically demanding and are often delegated to less experienced surgical staff such as junior residents who may be more likely to break the hardware . therefore , we believe that experienced staff surgeons should be available during procedures where titanium is being removed . having broken hardware in the elbow may complicate future surgeries in the same region of the limb . with regards to orthopaedic implants , it is known that both titanium alloy and commercially pure titanium hardware are more predisposed to in situ fracture relative to stainless steel 69 . as compared to stainless steel , titanium alloy is lighter , has a lower modulus of elasticity , and has superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility , but inferior ductility and notch sensitivity . the literature search performed for this review did not reveal any previous studies that compare hardware removal from the elbow in vivo for titanium and stainless steel fracture implants . in contrast to titanium implants remaining in situ for less than 12 months , we observed that the titanium implants remaining in situ for more than 12 months had a tendency to fail during extraction . in this series , it is likely that a combination of titanium alloy  is fatigue properties secondary to notch sensitivity and osseointegration were responsible for this observation . the fatigue strength of titanium alloy is generally comparable to stainless steel 316l , but notch sensitivity in both commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy has been shown to significantly shorten the fatigue life of these implants in comparison to stainless steel 1214 . osseointegration has been observed to occur within 310 months in titanium alloy 10 , 11 . the degree of bone ingrowth and on - growth , however , continues to increase for years after initial implantation ( figure 2 ) . although there have been studies showing evidence of stainless steel osseointegration , it is generally accepted that commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy are more biocompatible and more likely to osseointegrate than stainless steel . in our series , it is likely that as osseointegrataion became more complete , greater removal torques contributed to the failure of titanium alloy screws in this series . given these properties , we postulate that over longer periods and increased loading cycles , the development of micofractures and osseointegration contributed to screw breakage during implant removal . secondly , the cases studied were not uniform ; there were a wide variety fractures and hardware systems involved . in addition , due to the small number of cases it was necessary to include multiple surgeons . in addition , not all x - rays were available for review ; therefore we were not able to account for the type of hardware , such as locking or non locking plate technology . in this study , there appears to be a time - related association for bone screw failure during removal cases , and for titanium alloy in particular . this is likely due to the increased bone ingrowth and the adverse effect of notch sensitivity on titanium alloy  is fatigue properties .\",\n          \"normal c57bl6 mice and mice containing foxo1 knock -

or cyclophosphamide , vincristine , and prednisone ( cvp ) are well accepted by clinicians . in addition , chlorambucil - based chemotherapies such as mitoxantrone , chlorambucil , and prednisone ( mcp ) , and some fludarabine - based therapies e. g. fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and mitoxantrone ( fcm ) are commonly used , and bendamustine therapy has been investigated with promising results in these patients . maintenance therapy with rituximab is also the standard of care in patients with low - grade lymphoma . this has been known for some time to be the optimal approach for patients with relapsed disease , and the recent results of the prima study indicate that this is also the most effective treatment strategy for patients with fl after first - line treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy.3 there are currently few data on the use of non - pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( npld ) specifically in low - grade lymphoma . some of the publications available are case series , studies involving only small numbers of patients , or studies of patient populations with aggressive as well as low - grade lymphomas . one retrospective study of 37 patients with lymphomas who were either elderly or had cardiac comorbidities included three with fl , two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and one with multiple myeloma.4 these patients received npld in combination chemotherapy , and experienced a high rate of remission for this poor - risk population complete remission rates were 75 for diffuse large b - cell lymphoma and 55 for t nk - cell neoplasm ; overall response rates ( orr ) of 80 and 89 , respectively , with no major cardiac toxicities . rates of hematologic toxicity were comparable to those for regimens containing conventional anthracyclines.4 similarly , in a prospective study of 35 elderly and frail patients , five patients with fl received r - comp ( r - chop with npld substituted for conventional doxorubicin ) as a first - line therapy : r - comp was effective and well tolerated , and no cardiac events have been observed.5 again , the hematotoxicity of this combination was the same as that seen with the r - chop regimen . a small study has also been conducted using a combination of the new proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with npld , fludarabine , and ritux - imab in 16 patients with refractory relapsed mantle - cell lymphoma ( mcl).6 there was a good orr of 74 and 9 of 15 patients experienced a complete response ( cr ) or unconfirmed cr . rates of neutropenia ( 37.5 ) and thrombocytopenia ( 31.2 ) were high , as expected ; the rate of car - diotoxicity was 12.5 ( although no information is provided on how this was defined ) . the german study group for indolent lymphoma ( stil ) conducted a prospective , randomized phase iii trial ( nhl 1 - 2003 ) to compare the efficacy of bendamustine plus rituximab ( br ) with the widely accepted r - chop regimen in patients with low - grade lymphomas . the results were presented at the 2009 american society of hematology meeting as an oral presentation.7 bendamustine ( 90 mg m ) was administered on days 1 and 2 , with rituximab on day 1 , every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles . r - chop was given every 3 weeks , for a maximum of six cycles . in total , 513 patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity , most of whom ( 54 ) had fl , with the remainder having mcl ( 18 ) , marginal zone lymphoma ( mzl ; 13 ) , waldenstrm macroglobuline - mia ( wm ; 8 ) , and small lymphocytic leukemia ( sll ; 4 ) . there was a clear difference between br and r - chop in the incidence of grade iii and iv hemato - toxicities . there were significantly fewer cycles of br , compared with r - chop , in which patients experienced grade iii or iv leucocytopenia ( 12.1 versus 38.2 , respectively ) , neutropenia ( 10.7 versus 46.5 ) , or required granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( 4.0 versus 20.0 ; p0.0001 in all cases ) . br was associated only with grade 1 alopecia and there was a low incidence of paraesthesias and stomatitis compared with r - chop . on the other hand , almost all patients in the br treatment arm received the full dose of chemotherapy ( 96.1 of cycles ) , whereas a smaller proportion of cycles of r - chop were completed at the full dose of chemotherapy ( 88.8 ) . the orr was good in both groups : 93.8 for br and 93.5 for r - chop.7 the cr rate was significantly higher with br versus r - chop ( 40.1 versus 30.8 ; p0.0323 ) . progression - free survival ( pfs ) was significantly longer with br ( median pfs 54.8 months ) compared with r - chop ( median 34.8 months ) at a median observation period of 32 months hazard ratio ( hr ) 0.5765 ; 95 confidence interval ( ci ) 0.4292 - 0.7783 ; p0.0002 . similarly , event - free survival was 54 months for br and 31 months for r - chop ( hr 0.6014 ; 95 ci 0.4515 - 0.7845 ; p0.0002 ) . another key measure was the time to next treatment , which had not been reached in the br arm versus a median of 40.7 months with r - chop ( hr 0.5416 ; 95 ci 0.3897 - 0.7491 ; p0.0002 ) . in summary , this study demonstrated that br significantly improved pfs and cr rates , compared with r - chop , in patients with fl , mcl , and wm . the stil study is now underway to investigate the effect of duration of maintenance therapy with rituximab in fl , and the effect of ritux - imab maintenance therapy in other low - grade lymphoma entities . in the nhl 7 - 2008 ( maintain ) study ( nct00877214 ) , patients with fl will be randomized to either 2 or 4 years of rit - uximab maintenance therapy , every 2 months , following br induction therapy in addition , infectious complications can be studied prospectively in this patient population , which is important because it has been reported that rituximab treatment is associated with neutropenia and increases infectious complications.8 another part of the maintain study is designed to investigate the efficacy of maintenance therapy in other forms of low - grade lymphoma . patients with wm , mzl , or mcl will be randomized to either 2 years of maintenance therapy with rit - uximab every 2 months , or 2 years of watch and wait , both following br induction . studies with other agents are also ongoing . as discussed above , combination therapy with bortezomib , npld , fludarabine , and rituximab was shown in a small study to be effective in relapsed mcl.6 the stil nhl 8 - 2010 study plans to further investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with bortezomib in patients with relapsed low - grade lymphomas . lenalido - mide is another promising therapy in low - grade lymphomas , which has demonstrated good results in patients with several lymphoma types , in hard - to - treat relapsed or refractory disease . low - grade lymphomas will become chronic diseases , and many patients will require treatment over long periods of time , with many treatment cycles . r - chop is commonly used to treat low - grade lymphoma , though chlorambucil- and fludarabine - based regimens are also used . the efficacy and toxicity of r - chop may be improved by substitution of npld into this combination , although data on the use of liposomal doxorubicin are currently more focused on aggressive lymphomas . br therapy has produced promising results in several types of low - grade lymphoma , both in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes , and is recommended in the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) clinical practice guidelines in oncology ( v 1.2011 ) as first - line therapy for indolent lymphoma.11 the use of rituximab maintenance treatment after br induction is currently under investigation in different lymphoma types . in addition , the efficacy of a combination treatment of bortezomib and br will be studied .

or cyclophosphamide , vincristine , and prednisone ( cvp ) are well accepted by clinicians . in addition , chlorambucil - based chemotherapies such as mitoxantrone , chlorambucil , and prednisone ( mcp ) , and some fludarabine - based therapies e. g. fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and mitoxantrone ( fcm ) are commonly used , and bendamustine therapy has been investigated with promising results in these patients . maintenance therapy with rituximab is also the standard of care in patients with low - grade lymphoma . this has been known for some time to be the optimal approach for patients with relapsed disease , and the recent results of the prima study indicate that this is also the most effective treatment strategy for patients with fl after first - line treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy.3 there are currently few data on the use of non - pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( npld ) specifically in low - grade lymphoma . some of the publications available are case series , studies involving only small numbers of patients , or studies of patient populations with aggressive as well as low - grade lymphomas . one retrospective study of 37 patients with lymphomas who were either elderly or had cardiac comorbidities included three with fl , two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and one with multiple myeloma.4 these patients received npld in combination chemotherapy , and experienced a high rate of remission for this poor - risk population complete remission rates were 75 for diffuse large b - cell lymphoma and 55 for t nk - cell neoplasm ; overall response rates ( orr ) of 80 and 89 , respectively , with no major cardiac toxicities . rates of hematologic toxicity were comparable to those for regimens containing conventional anthracyclines.4 similarly , in a prospective study of 35 elderly and frail patients , five patients with fl received r - comp ( r - chop with npld substituted for conventional doxorubicin ) as a first - line therapy : r - comp was effective and well tolerated , and no cardiac events have been observed.5 again , the hematotoxicity of this combination was the same as that seen with the r - chop regimen . a small study has also been conducted using a combination of the new proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with npld , fludarabine , and ritux - imab in 16 patients with refractory relapsed mantle - cell lymphoma ( mcl).6 there was a good orr of 74 and 9 of 15 patients experienced a complete response ( cr ) or unconfirmed cr . rates of neutropenia ( 37.5 ) and thrombocytopenia ( 31.2 ) were high , as expected ; the rate of car - diotoxicity was 12.5 ( although no information is provided on how this was defined ) . the german study group for indolent lymphoma ( stil ) conducted a prospective , randomized phase iii trial ( nhl 1 - 2003 ) to compare the efficacy of bendamustine plus rituximab ( br ) with the widely accepted r - chop regimen in patients with low - grade lymphomas . the results were presented at the 2009 american society of hematology meeting as an oral presentation.7 bendamustine ( 90 mg m ) was administered on days 1 and 2 , with rituximab on day 1 , every 4 weeks for a maximum of six cycles . r - chop was given every 3 weeks , for a maximum of six cycles . in total , 513 patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity , most of whom ( 54 ) had fl , with the remainder having mcl ( 18 ) , marginal zone lymphoma ( mzl ; 13 ) , waldenstrm macroglobuline - mia ( wm ; 8 ) , and small lymphocytic leukemia ( sll ; 4 ) . there was a clear difference between br and r - chop in the incidence of grade iii and iv hemato - toxicities . there were significantly fewer cycles of br , compared with r - chop , in which patients experienced grade iii or iv leucocytopenia ( 12.1 versus 38.2 , respectively ) , neutropenia ( 10.7 versus 46.5 ) , or required granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( 4.0 versus 20.0 ; p0.0001 in all cases ) . br was associated only with grade 1 alopecia and there was a low incidence of paraesthesias and stomatitis compared with r - chop . on the other hand , almost all patients in the br treatment arm received the full dose of chemotherapy ( 96.1 of cycles ) , whereas a smaller proportion of cycles of r - chop were completed at the full dose of chemotherapy ( 88.8 ) . the orr was good in both groups : 93.8 for br and 93.5 for r - chop.7 the cr rate was significantly higher with br versus r - chop ( 40.1 versus 30.8 ; p0.0323 ) . progression - free survival ( pfs ) was significantly longer with br ( median pfs 54.8 months ) compared with r - chop ( median 34.8 months ) at a median observation period of 32 months hazard ratio ( hr ) 0.5765 ; 95 confidence interval ( ci ) 0.4292 - 0.7783 ; p0.0002 . similarly , event - free survival was 54 months for br and 31 months for r - chop ( hr 0.6014 ; 95 ci 0.4515 - 0.7845 ; p0.0002 ) . another key measure was the time to next treatment , which had not been reached in the br arm versus a median of 40.7 months with r - chop ( hr 0.5416 ; 95 ci 0.3897 - 0.7491 ; p0.0002 ) . in summary , this study demonstrated that br significantly improved pfs and cr rates , compared with r - chop , in patients with fl , mcl , and wm . the stil study is now underway to investigate the effect of duration of maintenance therapy with rituximab in fl , and the effect of ritux - imab maintenance therapy in other low - grade lymphoma entities . in the nhl 7 - 2008 ( maintain ) study ( nct00877214 ) , patients with fl will be randomized to either 2 or 4 years of rit - uximab maintenance therapy , every 2 months , following br induction therapy in addition , infectious complications can be studied prospectively in this patient population , which is important because it has been reported that rituximab treatment is associated with neutropenia and increases infectious complications.8 another part of the maintain study is designed to investigate the efficacy of maintenance therapy in other forms of low - grade lymphoma . patients with wm , mzl , or mcl will be randomized to either 2 years of maintenance therapy with rit - uximab every 2 months , or 2 years of watch and wait , both following br induction . studies with other agents are also ongoing . as discussed above , combination therapy with bortezomib , npld , fludarabine , and rituximab was shown in a small study to be effective in relapsed mcl.6 the stil nhl 8 - 2010 study plans to further investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with bortezomib in patients with relapsed low - grade lymphomas . lenalido - mide is another promising therapy in low - grade lymphomas , which has demonstrated good results in patients with several lymphoma types , in hard - to - treat relapsed or refractory disease . low - grade lymphomas will become chronic diseases , and many patients will require treatment over long periods of time , with many treatment cycles . r - chop is commonly used to treat low - grade lymphoma , though chlorambucil- and fludarabine - based regimens are also used . the efficacy and toxicity of r - chop may be improved by substitution of npld into this combination , although data on the use of liposomal doxorubicin are currently more focused on aggressive lymphomas . br therapy has produced promising results in several types of low - grade lymphoma , both in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes , and is recommended in the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) clinical practice guidelines in oncology ( v 1.2011 ) as first - line therapy for indolent lymphoma.11 the use of rituximab maintenance treatment after br induction is currently under investigation in different lymphoma types . in addition , the efficacy of a combination treatment of bortezomib and br will be studied .',\n",
              " 'summary': 'there are many therapies available for the management of low - grade lymphoma . with follicular lymphoma , for example , combination of chemotherapy and rituximab ( immuno - chemotherapy ) and consecutive maintenance therapy for 2 years is the current standard of care . to date , the most widely used regimen seems to be rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( r - chop ) . substitution of liposomal doxorubicin in place of conventional doxorubicin may improve outcomes in this indication , although evidence for its use in low - grade lymphoma is not as relevant as in aggressive lymphoma . bendamustine , in combination with rituximab , has shown very good efficacy and tolerability in several lymphoma types , particularly follicular lymphoma and other low - grade lymphomas . other combinations , such as those including bortezomib and lenalidomide , are under investigation in low - grade lymphoma , and the duration of rituximab maintenance therapy following bendamustine - rituximab - containing induction is being researched by the german study group for indolent lymphoma ( stil ) .

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants are among the most widely adopted renewable energy sources, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies harness natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other harmful pollutants. As a result, renewable energy has emerged as a key solution to mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. Moreover, the declining costs of renewable energy systems have made them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources, driving widespread adoption and investment in renewable energy infrastructure worldwide.

filled with purulent and decayed tissue and pus . blood was also obtained directly from the heart during autopsy and lactic acid was found . in this case we could think of a haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage due to clotting disorders possibly resulting from either acute fatty liver of pregnancy hellp syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic microangiopathy ( ttp hus ) or dic . in the conclusions of his 1843 book , scherer attached high importance to the fact that he found lactic acid in cases of puerperal fever , which he had not found before in healthy persons . he held the opinion that lactic acid was formed in blood during bodily deterioration in severe diseases like puerperal fever . lactic acid was thus described for the first time in human blood and was demonstrated for the first time as a symptom of septic and haemorrhagic shock . in the same period a junior obstetrician in vienna , ignaz philipp semmelweis ( 18181865 ) , discovered in 1847 that physicians carried infectious particles on their hands from the mortuary to the obstetrical clinic , causing puerperal fever and puerperal sepsis , and he introduced a successful method for its prevention . louis pasteur ( 18221894 ) found in 1879 that infection with streptococci was the most important cause of puerperal fever . scherer worked closely with the famous pathologist rudolf virchow ( 18211902 ) on several projects ( fig . 2 ) . in 1851 virchow performed an autopsy on a patient who had died from leukaemia and offered scherer blood from this patient for analysis . the results of this analysis were published the same year in the verhandlungen der physikalisch - medicinischen gesellschaft in wrzburg . virchow and scherer had previously studied the spleens of patients who died from leukaemia , and were curious if they could find the same results in the blood . scherer reached the conclusion that : the blood of this patient contains : ameisensure , essigsure und milchsure , die gleichfalls von mir schon frher als in der milzflssigkeit vorkommend bezeichnet wurden ( formic acid , acetic acid , and lactic acid , as also found by me previously in fluids from the spleen ) . 2johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 johann joseph scherer ( left ) and rudolf virchow ( right ) in 1849 scherer  is observations inspired others to conduct further research , primarily in patients with leukaemia 1922 , but also in patients with other conditions and diseases and in animal experiments with dogs and rabbits . while scherer found lactic acid in blood obtained after death during autopsy , mosler and krner mention an observation made by carl folwarczny , published in the allgemeinen wiener medicinischen zeitung in 1858 , where blood was withdrawn from a leukaemia patient during life , analysed according to scherer  is method , and found positive for lactic acid . in addition , carl folwarczny described in 1863 in his ' handbuch der physiologischen chemie ' that lactic acid can be found in the blood of patients with leukaemia , septicaemia ( pyaemia ) and in conditions leading to septicaemia like puerperal fever , the latter probably after scherer  is observations . in an extensive article , the berliner physician georg salomon , who had serious doubts that the occurrence of lactic acid in blood was mostly related to leukaemia , proved in 1878 that lactic acid was also present in the blood of patients who were suffering and died from other diseases . he studied blood obtained during autopsy from cadavers , but also blood from patients obtained by bloodletting or cupping , and in some cases he compared the blood before and after death . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in the blood of patients suffering from leukaemia , ( pernicious ) anaemia , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pleuritis , pericarditis , pneumonia and several solid malignant tumours . gaglio is often erroneously mentioned as the first author to find lactic acid in blood 2729 . he was able to demonstrate lactic acid in fresh arterial blood withdrawn from dogs and rabbits after bloodletting . both gaglio and berlinerblau , however , neglected previous research , as indignantly described by salomon in 1888 ich erlaube mir , den inhalt meiner arbeiten , die von gaglio nur ganz flchtig , von berlinerblau gar nicht berhrt sind , in krze zu reproduciren ( i take the liberty of summarizing the contents of my work , which was mentioned only briefly by gaglio and not at all by berlinerblau ) . the japanese chemist trasaburo araki showed that the amount of lactic acid in exhausted muscle results from muscle activation . irisawa , inspired by the results obtained by salomon and gaglio , obtained fresh blood of 11 dying patients with serious conditions . in six cases he found hyperlactataemia , in four cases normal values . he speculated on the aetiology of hyperlactataemia , the most plausible cause being the severe hypoxia during the dying process . in an experiment in which he made a dog anaemic for several days , he found a rise in lactic acid levels during the time leading up to death . in cambridge ( uk ) , walter morley fletcher ( 18731933 ) and frederick gowland hopkins ( 18611947 ) worked together on the metabolic changes occurring in muscular contractions and rigor mortis under anaerobic conditions , and found that lactate was the product of carbohydrate metabolism . their classic 1907 paper demonstrated rigorously that muscle contraction is accompanied by the anaerobic formation of lactic acid , which is removed aerobically , at a rate depending on the level of exposure to oxygen . poul astrup and john severingshaus mentioned scherer  is 1851 article as first demonstration of lactic acid in blood , but overlooked the 1843 cases and folwarczny  is work . in conclusion , scherer  is 1843 case reports should be cited as the first description of lactic

Summary: ', 'document': 'this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital ( 2014 - 09 - 037 ) . between november 2011 and october 2014 , 245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set ( cook medical , bloomington , in , usa ) due to prolonged endotracheal tube insertion . pdt was not performed in patients aged under 18 years , those with any pulsation palpated over the tracheostomy site , patients with a history of surgery or radiotherapy in the cervical region , and those with coagulopathy ( increased prothrombin time , inr 2 ) . the first four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique , with one physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt . the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse , with the physician using the bronchoscope only to confirm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simplified method described below . the remaining 186 procedures were performed using the simplified technique after repositioning the endotracheal tube at the predetermined depth ( 17 cm for males and 15 cm for females at the incisor ) . all pdts were performed by a single physician and one nurse , both of whom fully understood the entire procedure . the nurse administered sedatives and analgesics , as well as repositioning the endotracheal tube . except for patients with limited neck extension , a small pillow was placed under the patient  is shoulders to slightly extend the neck . transverse markings were made at the cricothyroid membrane and 2.0 cm toward the sternal notch ( fig . was also made in the midline of the trachea by holding the trachea between the thumb and index finger . the middle of the vertical mark intersected with the transverse mark 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane ( fig . if the cricothyroid membrane could not be palpated , ultrasonography was used to identify the anatomic structures . the cricoid cartilage and tracheal rings were identified by placing the linear probe 45 degrees from the sagittal plane , and the area between the second and third tracheal rings was marked with a skin marker ( figs . the linear probe was positioned vertical to the trachea to confirm its midline ( figs . fio2 was increased to 1.0 , and 57 cmh2o positive end - expiratory pressure was applied to all patients receiving ventilator care . in patients who were receiving oxygen supplementation via a hydro - trach t - piece , the pdt site was disinfected with povidone iodine solution and a sterile drape was used before subcutaneously injecting 2 lidocaine . a vertical skin incision ( 1.5 cm ) was made through the midline vertical marking , and the endotracheal tube was withdrawn until the tube depth was 17 cm for males and 15 cm for females ( fig . 1d ) using a 5 cm - introducer needle , included in the cook ciaglia blue rhino set , and proper needle position was confirmed by air regurgitation with a syringe containing normal saline . the remaining pdt procedure was performed using the previous standard method with a 7 tracheostomy tube ( twist , tracoe , germany ) . a 8 tube was used only in patients in whom bronchoscopic lavage was planned ( about 10 patients ) . however , all 3 patients were receiving either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy and had an abnormal coagulation status . bleeding in all three long -

sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) was identified in 937 ( 23.4 ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 1167 ( 13.4 ) of patients . preoperative ear culture studies identified pathogens in 3967 ( 58.2 ) of the patients : the most commonly identified species was staphylococcus mrcns 26.9 , methicillin - sensitive coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mscns ) 1.5 , mrsa 13.4 and mssa 11.9 . mrsa was found in 340 ( 4.5 ) ears , mssa in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) , mrcns in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) and mscns in 1 ear ( 1.5 ) . after the surgery , 11 of the 67 patients developed otorrhea within 1 month postoperatively . the postoperative culture studies identified mrsa in 311 ( 27.3 ) and acinetobacter species in 111 ( 9.1 ) and fungus in 211 ( 18.1 ) patients ( table 2 ) . preoperative ear culture results and nasal swab culture results showed significant difference ( p0.001 ) , as well as intraoperative middle ear cultures and postoperative otorrhea culture results showed significant difference ( p0.023 ) . however , no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.493 ) . then we compared the culture results according to the presence of bacterial growth and reports of no growth ( fig . no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear culture , and nasal swab culture results ( p0.055 ) , between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.068 ) , or nasal swab and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.094 ) . lastly , the culture results were compared according to the presence of antibiotic resistance ( fig . no significant difference was noted between the antibiotic -

sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) was identified in 937 ( 23.4 ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 1167 ( 13.4 ) of patients . preoperative ear culture studies identified pathogens in 3967 ( 58.2 ) of the patients : the most commonly identified species was staphylococcus mrcns 26.9 , methicillin - sensitive coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mscns ) 1.5 , mrsa 13.4 and mssa 11.9 . mrsa was found in 340 ( 4.5 ) ears , mssa in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) , mrcns in 2 ears ( 3.0 ) and mscns in 1 ear ( 1.5 ) . after the surgery , 11 of the 67 patients developed otorrhea within 1 month postoperatively . the postoperative culture studies identified mrsa in 311 ( 27.3 ) and acinetobacter species in 111 ( 9.1 ) and fungus in 211 ( 18.1 ) patients ( table 2 ) . preoperative ear culture results and nasal swab culture results showed significant difference ( p0.001 ) , as well as intraoperative middle ear cultures and postoperative otorrhea culture results showed significant difference ( p0.023 ) . however , no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.493 ) . then we compared the culture results according to the presence of bacterial growth and reports of no growth ( fig . no significant difference was noted between preoperative ear culture , and nasal swab culture results ( p0.055 ) , between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.068 ) , or nasal swab and postoperative otorrhea culture results ( p0.094 ) . lastly , the culture results were compared according to the presence of antibiotic resistance ( fig . no significant difference was noted between the antibiotic - susceptible and resistant strains identified between preoperative ear culture and nasal swab cultures ( p0.098 ) , or between preoperative ear and postoperative otorrhea cultures ( p0.053 ) . then we analyzed the correlation of isolated organisms from the nasal swab and other cultures in patients with nasal colonization of antibiotic - resistant strains ( fig . 4 ) . among 4 patients with identified with nasal mrsa colonization , preoperative ear cultures were also positive for mrsa in 3 patients ( 75.0 ) . however , intraoperative culture identified mrsa in only one patient , and none of the patients developed mrsa infection postoperatively . preoperative ear cultures reported mrsa in 1 , mrcns in 1 , and mscns in 7 , ciprobay - resistant pseudomonas in 1 , and no growth in 2 patients . increasing incidence of antibiotic - resistant bacterial strains in csom patients poses a challenge to not only the selection of appropriate antibiotics therapy , but also to prevent the emergence of resistance to glycopeptides , the main drugs chosen for mrsa . it has been reported that patients who are colonized with s. aureus are the main source of s. aureus in hospitals , and that nasal carriage of mrsa increases the risk of postoperative infection . since the rate of methicillin resistance is higher in korean csom patients compared to other countries , we examined the rate of nasal mrsa colonization . the rate of nasal carriage of mrsa in csom patients was higher than among healthy individuals reported as 0.2 - 2.8 of the united states population.7 ) although this study was limited to small number of patients , the finding may suggest that in addition to nosocomial infection , community - acquired mrsa infection may contribute partially to the relatively higher rate of mrsa in csom patients in korea . on the other hand , the rates of bacterial isolation from preoperative ear discharge , intraoperative middle ear discharge , or postoperative otorrhea cultures in our patients were lower . also , the perioperative culture studies frequently reported no growth of pathogens . given that the patients were prescribed with antibiotics prior to surgery , it may signify that current antibiotics are effective in infection control during the tympanomastoid surgery . furthermore , the interpretation of the culture results from postoperative otorrhea is limited since antibiotics were routinely used postoperatively in all patients and culture samples were taken from the external auditory canal in cases with overt otorrhea or from wet surface of the grafted tympanic membrane immediately after removal of the packing material at 2 weeks postoperatively . the culture results can only reflect that mrsa infection that could not be controlled by routine antibiotics , which may be clinically significant . mrsa has been identified not only in csom patients,2,3,5,13 ) but also in patients with external otitis.14 ) s. aureus has been implicated in biofilm formation complicating cochlear implants.15 - 17 ) nasal mrsa colonization deserves attention since transmission from nasal carriage to surgical site infections or bacteremia is possible , and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality . previous studies have reported that elimination of nasal mrsa colonization reduces the risk of postoperative infections.8,18,19 ) application of 2 mupirocin calcium ointment to the nares has been proven to be effective , and chlorhexidine - based solutions is used to reduce the density of skin colonization of mrsa preoperatively.18 - 20 ) a recent study compared the rates of mrsa infection in otolaryngology surgeries , before and after implementation of preoperative screening and treatment of nasal mrsa carriage.21 ) further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries . the rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community . further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries .', 'summary': 'background and objectivesmethicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) is one of major pathogens in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media ( csom ) . in addition to intrinsic mrsa infection of the mastoid air cell system , nasal colonization of mrsa , a known predictor of postoperative surgical site infection , may pose increased risk of postoperative complications . the purpose of this study is to describe microbiology of preoperative nasal swab screening and localized middle ear specimens in patients undergoing otologic surgeries. subjects and methodsforty - nine consecutive patients with csom who underwent middle ear surgery were included . preoperative nasal swabs for mrsa , and preoperative and intraoperative middle ear swabs were collected and compared for pathogens. resultspreoperative nasal swab screening confirmed mrsa colonization in 349 patients ( 6.1 ) and methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( mrcns ) in 949 patients ( 18.4 ) . correlation with preoperative culture results and nasal swab screening results were compatible in 24 patients with positive nasal swab for mrsa and 19 patients with positive nasal swab for mrcns . postoperative conversion to mrsa was observed in 3 patients. conclusionsthe rate of nasal mrsa colonization among patients with csom was higher than among the general community . preoperative mrsa colonization was associated with mrsa from middle ear specimens . further studies are warranted to investigate the possible benefit of preoperative treatment of mrsa colonized patients undergoing middle ear surgeries .

ray findings of a filling defect in the cecum with non - visualization of the appendix . on ct and ultrasonography , a nodular , enhancing lesion in the wall of the mucocele is suggestive of malignant disease . sometimes , it is asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at surgery or during imaging evaluation for another disease . if a mucocele is found , therapy is surgical . the appropriate type of surgical treatment is related to the dimensions and the histology of the mucocele . an appendectomy is used for simple mucoceles or cystadenomas when the appendiceal base is intact . cecal resection is indicated for cystadenomas with a large base , and a right hemicolectomy is recommended for cystadenocarcinomas . the 10-year survival of patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinomas is 65 among patients treated by hemicolectomy , but only 37 among patients treated by appendectomy alone . while several cases of laparoscopic treatment of appendiceal mucoceles have been reported 4 - 8 , many authors suggest that the laparoscopic approach should be avoided because of the increased risk of rupture and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . pseudomyxoma peritonei is caused by spillage and implantation of mucin - secreting cells into the peritoneal cavity . thus , we reasoned that the complication rate of pseudomyxoma peritonei during laparoscopic surgery would be the same as that of open surgery if a minimal - touch technique was utilized . reported the laparoscopic resection of a 12 cm large mucocele using gravity and position during minimal manipulation of the lesion . also reported successful laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele and suggested that conversion to a laparotomy should be considered if the lesion is grasped traumatically or if the tumor clearly extends beyond the appendix . recently , chiu et al . presented a case involving the successful laparoscopic resection of an 8 cm appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma . gonzlez moreno et al . reported a case of an appendiceal mucinous tumor resected by laparoscopy associated with subsequent diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis . they suggested that if distention of the appendiceal lumen is observed laparoscopically , suggesting a mucocele as a possible diagnosis , conversion to open appendectomy may be the most prudent surgical judgment . we performed laparoscopic resections of two appendiceal mucoceles using a laparoscopic bag to retain and retract the mucocele , in addition to using gravity and position , therefore we avoided grasping the tumor directly . the application of laparoscopic surgery has been more widely adopted in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases , and in some cases laparoscopic surgery is currently the standard treatment . in the surgical treatment of appendiceal mucoceles , however , open surgery is currently the standard surgical treatment due to its well - known safety and easy accessibility . the authors are also aware of the possibility of rupture during laparoscopic dissection , and the subsequent fatal complication of pseudomyxoma peritonei . nevertheless , if we can handle the tissue with minimal manipulation , and can secure enough safety by using various laparoscopic instruments , laparoscopic resection of an appendiceal mucocele might be an alternative surgical option to open surgery .', 'summary': 'laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucoceles has recently been described , but the safety and efficacy are controversial . we present two cases of laparoscopic mucocelectomies involving 14 and 15 cm cystic masses originating from the appendix . the laparoscopic mucocelectomies were performed using four ports . from the beginning of the procedure , a laparoscopic bag was used to safely contain the mucocele , prevent rupture of the mucocele , and retract the mucocele . an endoscopic stapling device was used to transect the base of the cecum . minimal handling was achieved by gravity and with the use of laparoscopic instruments . laparoscopic appendectomies are widely performed for acute appendicitis , but laparoscopic resection is not routinely performed for an appendiceal mucocele because of the risk of perforation and subsequent pseudomyxoma peritonei . we report two cases of laparoscopic appendiceal mucocelectomies , which were performed safely with laparoscopic instruments and minimal manipulation .

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants are among the most widely adopted renewable energy sources, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies harness natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other harmful pollutants. As a result, renewable energy has emerged as a key solution to mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. Moreover, the declining costs of renewable energy systems have made them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources, driving widespread adoption and investment in renewable energy infrastructure worldwide.
