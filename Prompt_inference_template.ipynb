    "Prompt injection is a technique that involves adding a prompt to the input of a language model to guide its output. The prompt can be a sentence, a paragraph, or a set of instructions that the model should follow. In this study, we will experiment with different prompt injection strategies to guide the model to generate summaries of specific lengths and formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly focus on the following prompt injection strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning-based prompts: \n",
    "-   Generate a text {10-20-30} times shorter\n",
    "-   Generate a text of length eâ€¢ln^2 w.r.t. the number of words in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruction-based prompts:\n",
    "-   Generate a summary of {50-75-100-125-150-175-200} words\n",
    "-   Generate a 1-sentence summary\n",
    "-   Generate a bullet point of 3-5-10 items summarizing the document"

       "\"Generate a summary 10 times shorter for the following text: survival rates continue to improve with the advent of more refined treatments and better supportive care . today over 80 of children with cancer are alive for at least five years , and the majority of these are cured . as a consequence , many sufferers of childhood cancer are now living into adulthood and having families of their own . it has been estimated that about 1 in 900 adults aged 18 to 44 years is a cancer survivor . among this group , those with an inherited susceptibility to cancer will transmit their genetic fault to a proportion of their children . they are also at risk of developing a second cancer during their adult life . while the causes of the majority of childhood cancers are largely unknown , there are a number of clinical syndromes for which the evidence for an excess cancer risk in children is most persuasive . these include li - fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis type i , inherited retinoblastoma mutations , familial wilms tumor , and some disorders of dna repair . these syndromes collectively account for less than 10 of all childhood cancers , however . beyond this , it is not clear if cancer in childhood increases the risk of cancer in relatives . a number of recent studies have described an association between childhood cancer and cancer in first - degree relatives 57 , particularly siblings 5 , 7 and mothers . in this study , we describe the distribution of cancers in australian children and estimate the risks of cancer in their relatives . it was established from the clinical services at the royal children  is hospital ( rch ) and the monash medical centre ( mmc ) , between which over 95 of children under 10 years of age and 83 of children aged 1015 years with cancer within the state of victoria , australia , are treated . children were eligible for inclusion if they had a diagnosis of any cancer before age 15 and when initial treatment was given at one of the participating centres between october 1998 and october 2002 . the human research ethics committee at each participating institution reviewed and approved the protocol before enrolment commenced . a total of 486 ( 422 at rch and 64 at mmc ) incident cases of childhood cancer were diagnosed during the study period . of these , 21 families were found to be ineligible ( seven non - english speaking parents , seven where the proband was aged over 15 years , six where the proband did not have their initial treatment at either service , and one where the proband was adopted ) . of the remaining 465 families , 21 were not contactable , 53 refused to participate , 6 were lost to followup , and 6 later withdrew consent . this left 379 ( 82 ) families participating ( 340 at rch and 39 at mmc ) , from which we interviewed 351 ( 92.6 ) fathers and 371 ( 97.9 ) mothers . in 343 ( 90.5 ) families , both the mother and father were interviewed , while in 28 ( 7.4 ) families only the mother was interviewed and in 8 ( 2.1 ) families only the father was interviewed . at the time of enrolment , both parents of the affected child were asked a baseline questionnaire that included information on lifestyle and environmental risk factors and a detailed family history of cancer . where half siblings were identified , the appropriate , biologically relevant family history was obtained . the family history of cancer questionnaire asked about all of the affected child  is siblings , parents , aunts , uncles , and grandparents ( i. e. all first - degree and second - degree relatives ) . parents were asked to identify each first - degree and second - degree relative , any known cancer diagnoses with the age ( in years ) at diagnosis , and type of malignancy , together with their current age or age at the time of death . the information collected was reviewed and classified by the authors with expertise in cancer ( jah ; es ) . the world health organization  is international classification of diseases for oncology , 3rd edition ( id - o-3 ) scheme , was used for classification of site of malignancy . nonmelanoma skin cancers , nonmalignant tumours , and in situ cancerswere not included in the analyses . to address the potential contribution of known familial cancer syndromes , we examined the medical records of the 26 affected children who had a first - degree relative with cancer . in particular , we sought clinical evidence for li - fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis type 1 , familial retinoblastoma , and familial wilm  is tumour syndrome . person - years at risk for the cohort of relatives were calculated as the time to date of diagnosis of cancer , date of death , or date of interview completion , whichever occurred earliest . australian population - based cancer incidence data , specific for gender , age , and year of birth , were obtained from the australian institute of health and welfare . standardised incidence ratios were used to compare the number of observed cancers in relatives with the number expected in the australian population . robust estimates for confidence intervals were calculated to account for potential clustering within a family . all statistical tests were two - sided and a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant . the distribution of childhood cancers diagnosed in the cohort of 379 children is summarized in table 1 . a family history for cancer was identified in 4,736 ( 1,337 first - degree and 3,399 second - degree ) relatives with a total of 211,394 person - years of followup . fourteen of the 379 ( 3.7 ) families reported a positive history for childhood cancer in any relative , with none having more than one case identified . twenty - six children with cancer ( 6.9 ) had a first - degree relative ( parent or sibling ) with a history of cancer . the results for the family history of cancer in all childhood cancer patients are summarized in table 2 . there was a higher than expected , though not statistically significant , incidence of childhood cancer among first - degree relatives ( sir 1.43 ; 95 ci 0.545.08 ) . there was also a higher than expected , though not statistically significant , incidence of cancer among first - degree relatives ( sir 1.45 ; 95 ci 0.932.1 ) . there was a statistically significant increase in cancer among female first - degree relatives ( sir 1.82 ; 95 ci 1.263.39 ) . the increased family cancer history in first - degree females was largely attributable to an effect in mothers ( sir 1.78 ; 95 ci 1.273.33 ) but was also observed in sisters ( sir 2.15 ; n 1 ) . elevated cancer incidence rates were also observed in aunts ( sir 1.48 ; 95 ci 1.112.00 ) . the gender - specific association was reflected in higher than expected incidence rates of breast cancer in mothers ( sir 1.92 ;

       "\"Generate a summary 10 times shorter for the following text: In recent years, advances in renewable energy technologies have significantly expanded the options for generating clean and sustainable electricity. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric power plants are among the most widely adopted renewable energy sources, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies harness natural resources like sunlight, wind, and water to produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or other harmful pollutants. As a result, renewable energy has emerged as a key solution to mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on finite fossil fuel resources. Moreover, the declining costs of renewable energy systems have made them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources, driving widespread adoption and investment in renewable energy infrastructure worldwide. Example summary: Renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydro are gaining traction as clean alternatives to fossil fuels, offering environmentally friendly electricity generation without greenhouse gas emissions.Generate a summary 10 times shorter for the following text: survival rates continue to improve with the advent of more refined treatments and better supportive care . today over 80 of children with cancer are alive for at least five years , and the majority of these are cured . as a consequence , many sufferers of childhood cancer are now living into adulthood and having families of their own . it has been estimated that about 1 in 900 adults aged 18 to 44 years is a cancer survivor . among this group , those with an inherited susceptibility to cancer will transmit their genetic fault to a proportion of their children . they are also at risk of developing a second cancer during their adult life . while the causes of the majority of childhood cancers are largely unknown , there are a number of clinical syndromes for which the evidence for an excess cancer risk in children is most persuasive . these include li - fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis type i , inherited retinoblastoma mutations , familial wilms tumor , and some disorders of dna repair . these syndromes collectively account for less than 10 of all childhood cancers , however . beyond this , it is not clear if cancer in childhood increases the risk of cancer in relatives . a number of recent studies have described an association between childhood cancer and cancer in first - degree relatives 57 , particularly siblings 5 , 7 and mothers . in this study , we describe the distribution of cancers in australian children and estimate the risks of cancer in their relatives . it was established from the clinical services at the royal children  is hospital ( rch ) and the monash medical centre ( mmc ) , between which over 95 of children under 10 years of age and 83 of children aged 1015 years with cancer within the state of victoria , australia , are treated . children were eligible for inclusion if they had a diagnosis of any cancer before age 15 and when initial treatment was given at one of the participating centres between october 1998 and october 2002 . the human research ethics committee at each participating institution reviewed and approved the protocol before enrolment commenced . a total of 486 ( 422 at rch and 64 at mmc ) incident cases of childhood cancer were diagnosed during the study period . of these , 21 families were found to be ineligible ( seven non - english speaking parents , seven where the proband was aged over 15 years , six where the proband did not have their initial treatment at either service , and one where the proband was adopted ) . of the remaining 465 families , 21 were not contactable , 53 refused to participate , 6 were lost to followup , and 6 later withdrew consent . this left 379 ( 82 ) families participating ( 340 at rch and 39 at mmc ) , from which we interviewed 351 ( 92.6 ) fathers and 371 ( 97.9 ) mothers . in 343 ( 90.5 ) families , both the mother and father were interviewed , while in 28 ( 7.4 ) families only the mother was interviewed and in 8 ( 2.1 ) families only the father was interviewed . at the time of enrolment , both parents of the affected child were asked a baseline questionnaire that included information on lifestyle and environmental risk factors and a detailed family history of cancer . where half siblings were identified , the appropriate , biologically relevant family history was obtained . the family history of cancer questionnaire asked about all of the affected child  is siblings , parents , aunts , uncles , and grandparents ( i. e. all first - degree and second - degree relatives ) . parents were asked to identify each first - degree and second - degree relative , any known cancer diagnoses with the age ( in years ) at diagnosis , and type of malignancy , together with their current age or age at the time of death . the information collected was reviewed and classified by the authors with expertise in cancer ( jah ; es ) . the world health organization  is international classification of diseases for oncology , 3rd edition ( id - o-3 ) scheme , was used for classification of site of malignancy . nonmelanoma skin cancers , nonmalignant tumours , and in situ cancerswere not included in the analyses . to address the potential contribution of known familial cancer syndromes , we examined the medical records of the 26 affected children who had a first - degree relative with cancer . in particular , we sought clinical evidence for li - fraumeni syndrome , neurofibromatosis type 1 , familial retinoblastoma , and familial wilm  is tumour syndrome . person - years at risk for the cohort of relatives were calculated as the time to date of diagnosis of cancer , date of death , or date of interview completion , whichever occurred earliest . australian population - based cancer incidence data , specific for gender , age , and year of birth , were obtained from the australian institute of health and welfare . standardised incidence ratios were used to compare the number of observed cancers in relatives with the number expected in the australian population . robust estimates for confidence intervals were calculated to account for potential clustering within a family . all statistical tests were two - sided and a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant . the distribution of childhood cancers diagnosed in the cohort of 379 children is summarized in table 1 . a family history for cancer was identified in 4,736 ( 1,337 first - degree and 3,399 second - degree ) relatives with a total of 211,394 person - years of followup . fourteen of the 379 ( 3.7 ) families reported a positive history for childhood cancer in any relative , with none having more than one case identified . twenty - six children with cancer ( 6.9 ) had a first - degree relative ( parent or sibling ) with a history of cancer . the results for the family history of cancer in all childhood cancer patients are summarized in table 2 . there was a higher than expected , though not statistically significant , incidence of childhood cancer among first - degree relatives ( sir 1.43 ; 95 ci 0.545.08 ) . there was also a higher than expected , though not statistically significant , incidence of cancer among first - degree relatives ( sir 1.45 ; 95 ci 0.932.1 ) . there was a statistically significant increase in cancer among female first - degree relatives ( sir 1.82 ; 95 ci 1.263.39 ) . the increased family cancer history in first - degree females was largely attributable to an effect in mothers ( sir 1.78 ; 95 ci 1.273.33 ) but was also observed in sisters ( sir 2.15 ; n 1 ) . elevated cancer incidence rates were also observed in aunts ( sir 1.48 ; 95 ci 1.112.00 ) . the gender - specific association was reflected in higher than expected incidence rates of breast cancer in mothers ( sir 1.92 ; 95 ci 0.726.83 ) , aunts ( sir 1.64 ; 95 ci 0.982.94 ) and to a lesser extent grandmothers ( sir 1.04 ; 95 ci 0.781.40 ) . although numbers were small , an increased cancer incidence in relatives appeared to be most apparent in the children with sarcomas ( sir 2.58 ;
