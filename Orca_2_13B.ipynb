Narrow AI is the type of AI that can only perform a specific task or a subset of tasks, such as speech recognition, chess playing, or self-driving cars. General AI is the type of AI that can perform any task that a human can, such as understanding context, emotions, creativity, and common sense. General AI is still a hypothetical and elusive goal for AI researchers, while narrow AI has achieved significant progress and applications in various domains.
